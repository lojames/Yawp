  - :body: The Halal Guys is iconic NYC. Everyone used to flock here after a night
      in the clubs back in the 00&#39;s.  The lines were long.  The customers drunk,
      boisterous and oftentimes looking to pick a fight.  And someone would always
      wait to buy food for everyone else.  10 combos, extra white sauce please.  <br><br>Nowadays,
      the lines are short and orderly.  Everyone knows they&#39;ll get their food.  DH
      and I were walking to Hells Kitchen last week when we passed Halal Guys.  We
      reminisced about all the times we ate their combo plate, we had even made it
      a moving day ritual at one time.  Of course, we stopped in our tracks, skipping
      out on our reservation and got on line.  We needed to see if the food was even
      close to our memories.  The line moved fast.  DH ordered a regular combo and
      I ordered a small falafel platter as I stopped eating meat 2 years ago. Both
      come with yellow rice, lettuce and pita.  The white sauce was just as good as
      I remember it.  You need it, the food is a bit dry without it and the hot sauce
      is as spicy as I remember it.  Use sparingly!!  You will ruin your food if you
      use too much, in addition to burn your mouth!  Use a little at a time, you can
      always add more!  My falafel was decent, not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but
      the white sauce and hot sauce made the dish.  The small was just the right portion
      size. <br><br>I don&#39;t usually eat street meat so don&#39;t have a point
      of comparison.  I can say you should eat at Halal Guys though because it&#39;s
      still the best street meat I&#39;ve ever eaten!

      hard to eat standing up. Not a complaint because that&#39;s what happens when
      you go to a food truck. So if comfort is really important then this might not
      be the right spot. <br><br>Overall really good, and I highly recommend it.

      is a food cart. Though now, they have multiple branches in the city itself and
      also all over the country and the world which are not food carts but food joints
      with sitting space.<br><br>Simple menu - chicken (great tasting), beef (even
      better tasting), pork (not anymore at this cart for some reason - but again
      is great tasting), falafel (kind of okay tasting) - over yellow over rice. With
      white sauce (yum - put lots), hot sauce (yum but very spicy. Pro tip- put only
      a few drops ..it would burn your mouth !!!!) and bbq sauce (good). <br>This
      joint doesn&#39;t have it but some of them also have gyros and baklava (very
      sweet but really good).<br><br>$7 per plate (was $6 till very recently) - huge
      portions - would easily last 2 meals.<br><br>Open till late. And almost till
      4 am on the weekends. Have had many a post-binge-drinking-night-3am-meals here
      !<br><br>Only con - No sitting at this location. So people mostly do a take
      away or sit on the parapets of the surrounding buildings.<br><br>Always a long

      2 packets of white sauce which is world popular and one of the main reason why
      halal guys is soooo popular. You also get few packets of red sauce. It&#39;s

  - :body: My girlfriend from NYC directed us to eat here. Her specific instruction
      was to go to &#34;The Halal Guys&#34; cart. The name must have all three words,
      no less/no more, or else you&#39;re eating at a copy cat! THE. HALAL. GUYS.
      Remember that! And, it&#39;s the cart across the street from Hilton on W 53rd
      and 6th.<br><br>We found THE HALAL GUYS! Lol. Yep, there was a little wait on
      a Thursday at 1:30pm. But, not too long. A huge batch of meats were already
      prepared on the hot plate and ready to be scooped up and placed into a round
      foil platter or wrapped up into a sandwich.<br><br>Between the two of us, we
      decided to share a regular size Platter C, which was the Chicken and Beef Gyro
      combo. Lettuce, chicken, and beef over a bed of turmeric and cumin seasoned
      basmati rice with a few small slices of pita bread. Our plate was placed into
      a plastic bag with two packets of their famous white sauce and one packet of

      here just to try it out. It was around 6pm and still raining a bit. I ordered
      a combo platter and got my food very fast because all the guy did was scoop
      the content from the containers. <br><br>I don&#39;t know if they normally would
      refresh it up when it&#39;s not raining, but maybe because they didn&#39;t,
      the meat felt a bit dry. Rice was good, i always enjoy Mediterranean rice. The
      vegetable portion was just iceberg lettuce. Where sauce was decent. Hot sauce
      was supppper hot like the dry hot type that just burns. The whole experience
      just felt underwhelming and disappointing. I have had tastier Mediterranean
      food from other food stands of NYC.

      like a chicken over rice platter at 2:00 in the morning. However, there has
      to be well over a thousand in the city. But this one? This is THE Halal Cart.
      <br><br>I&#39;m not sure if this was the first, or how this cart came to stardom,
      but this was the cart that started the national chain of Halal Guys locations.
      They&#39;re fast, they&#39;re efficient, and they make some good food.<br><br>You&#39;ll
      see people lined up from streets away below their yellow umbrellas... and the
      lines MOVE. You can be in the back of a line of 30 people, and still get your
      food within minutes. Right near the carts is a block of public benches, providing
      a good place to sit down with your food.<br><br>The regular sized platter itself
      is enough food for the entire day in one sitting, but they also offer a small
      sized platter or gyros.<br><br>All in all, if you want to eat a lot for cheap
      in New York City, and you want it fast? Go to the Halal Guys.

      literally the best Hala food (and food in general) that we&#39;ve ever had.

      and their hot sauce packs a punch!  Everything went perfectly together. <br><br>Overall:
      One of the best food places in New York. Everybody needs to eat here at some

      took my meal to the hotel room and ate it there. This meat is very good and
      it is accompanied by a salad, rice, and sliced pita bread. They also give you
      a white sauce and hot sauce if you want to add to it. I used the white sauce
      and it was so good and very filling.<br><br>You can&#39;t beat a bargain like

      in the same general vicinity. They are marked &#34;the real&#34; Halal guys.  I

      extra hot sauces. They sure know the fastest way to my heart. Meat + rice +
      EXTRA hot sauce. What else can I possibly ask for? <br><br>Apparently this place
      started all the way back in 1990, and 3 partners came up with a halal food cart
      with chicken and gyro over rice because of a high demand from Muslim cab drivers!
      Good thing they did because I freaking LOVE this place. <br><br>Whenever I come

      so that I can buy 4 - 6 platters of Combo ($8/each) to bring back home (Baltimore)
      with me. Of course, extra hot sauce please! <br><br>When I get home, I open
      up these bad boys, drown them in their famous white and red sauce. CAUTION:
      their red/hot sauce is ACTUALLY spicy!!!! I thought I was born with an iron
      stomach that can withstand all levels of spice but Halal Guys proved me wrong
      - usually 1 packet of red sauce for the entire platter is enough but I like
      to push my limit and put 2 - 3 packets. YESSSSSS, BURN MY SOUL!!!!<br><br>Their
      pita bread does get soggy because it sits in the platter on the way home but
      this is easily fixed if I pop them into the toaster oven for a few minutes!'

      heightened the flavors to a whole other level. Ugh. Wish we had this in Hawaii.
      But I do see The Halal Guys is now in CA and NV! Sweet! I&#39;ll have to check
      them out on the West Coast.<br><br>If you&#39;re wondering about Halal meat,
      it is pork free and produced in accordance with Islamic rules and contains Halal
      ingredients and is lawful for Muslim consumption.

      here just to try it out. It was around 6pm and still raining a bit. I ordered
      a combo platter and got my food very fast because all the guy did was scoop
      the content from the containers. <br><br>I don&#39;t know if they normally would
      refresh it up when it&#39;s not raining, but maybe because they didn&#39;t,
      the meat felt a bit dry. Rice was good, i always enjoy Mediterranean rice. The
      vegetable portion was just iceberg lettuce. Where sauce was decent. Hot sauce
      was supppper hot like the dry hot type that just burns. The whole experience
      just felt underwhelming and disappointing. I have had tastier Mediterranean
      food from other food stands of NYC.

      an awkward time (10:30 am), but the line looked longer during the lunch rush.<br><br>Food:
      We ordered the chicken and gyro combo platter. Not to be extra, but this is
      literally the best Hala food (and food in general) that we&#39;ve ever had.
      Their portions were perfect, the meat was well seasoned, the rice was unique,
      and their hot sauce packs a punch!  Everything went perfectly together. <br><br>Overall:
      One of the best food places in New York. Everybody needs to eat here at some
      point in their life. You get more than your money&#39;s worth here and won&#39;t
      be disappointed! We&#39;d recommend beating the lunch/dinner rushes and having
      a drink to pair with the delicious hot sauce!'

      x, the noodles are better at y, but the best complete package is at Ippudo,
      in my opinion. The all-stars are always on the menu but they also run specials

      Not to mention, the best shishito peppers can be had here. 5 stars - great experience,

  - :body: A historic deli in the heart of the Lower East Side. This delicatessen
      isn&#39;t just an eatery, it&#39;s an institution and has remained virtually
      untouched since 1917, when it opened in its current location (originally opened
      across the street in 1888). This was an important congregating spot for newly
      immigrated families in the early 20th century. <br><br>Their pastrami is incredible
      and famous. They cure it for over 30 DAYS and it shows. Tender, melts in your
      mouth. They always give you a tasting before you buy. <br><br>We ordered the
      pastrami on rye, the corned beef on rye, the cold roast beef, 2 matzah ball
      soups, and it all comes with a plate of their half and full sours. The pickles
      are INCREDIBLE and I miss being able to find those crunchy half sours in California.
      <br><br>Everything was perfection. Next time, we&#39;d share one sandwich. They
      are that big!!

  - :body: Got a taste of Katz&#39;s when they did a collab with Au Cheval in Chicago,
      so I knew I had to go when I visited New York. But also, so many people have
      told me I had to make a stop there. My friend and I went pretty early in the
      morning and it was our first time there, so we were a bit confused about the
      process. Since there weren&#39;t many people there, the workers were a bit more
      patient with us. We just ordered the classic pastrami and we&#39;re so glad
      that the two of us shared it because it was a monster of a sandwich! I&#39;m
      usually not a big fan of mustard, but the mustard added a nice and slight kick.
      Also, the pickles - perfect. <br><br>When you walk in, you get a ticket (DONT
      LOSE THIS). On the very right side there&#39;s a smaller menu, but they also
      just have it up on the wall. You order wherever someone is ready to take your
      order, you grab your stuff, take it to the cashier and they write on your ticket.
      You go and eat, then once you&#39;re done, go back to the cashier and pay. They&#39;ll
      give you your ticket and receipt back and you have to hand it to the guy at
      the door, and then you&#39;re good to go.

      order anything, they are super strict about returning the ticket when you exit.<br><br>I
      split a pastrami on rye with my friend and let me tell you....I don&#39;t like
      pastrami. Never have and thought I never would. Actually, not even a huge fan
      of sandwiches. But this specific sandwich is BOMBBBBB. Serving size is pretty
      big so I&#39;d recommend splitting with a friend if you&#39;re not that hungry
      or can&#39;t eat that much. Ingredients are prepared fresh and the pickles that
      come with the sandwich are the perfect amount of juice and crunch. When they
      ask you how much mustard you want on your sandwich, don&#39;t hold back. Tell
      them to pour that thangggg ON. Their mustard is so bomb and I regret not adding
      more to the sandwich initially.<br><br>I&#39;m salivating thinking about this,
      tbh. There&#39;s a reason why Katz&#39;s has 11,000+ reviews. If you are ever
      in New York, GO!!! No matter your schedule, make room for this.

      both locals and tourists come here to get their famous pastrami sandwich.<br><br>Need
      to know:<br>1)When you arrive, you will be handed a ticket. This ticket allows
      you to order, do not lose this ticket or you will have to pay extra.<br>2)Know
      what you want before you get to the front. You will get kicked to the back of
      the line if you reach the front... and locals will laugh.<br><br>The hot pastrami
      sandwich is the go to sandwich. Smoked and juicy pastrami between two slices
      of bread. It is a delight! Along with the pickles and cucumbers, it makes for
      the perfect lunch.

      30 minutes to try this place out. Being that I&#39;m from LA, their setup kind
      of reminded me of Philippe&#39;s setup back home (obviously they sell different
      things though). <br><br>We ordered the combo sandwich which came with both pastrami
      and corned beef. The sandwich was about $21, but was definitely more than enough
      to share for two people.<br><br>The pastrami was some of the best pastrami&#39;s
      I&#39;ve ever had...EVER. It was definitely drool-worthy and just had that type
      of taste where you want to close your eyes after that first bite. <br><br>The
      corned beef, however, was a little odd for me. It didn&#39;t have the same flavor
      that I&#39;m familiar with. Maybe that&#39;s how the restaurant makes it, but
      to me it had a weird after taste. <br><br>IMO: Skip the corned beef and stick
      with the pastrami! <br><br>Definitely a must visit place when coming to NYC!'

  - :body: Katz&#39;s is a very popular Lower East Side deli. They&#39;re famous for
      their large meat sandwiches. Ive heard several people say its the best corned
      beefed/or rueben they&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;m not a huge meat eater so I usually
      get fries and a soda. <br><br>Extremely popular with tourists, this place is
      always packed with a line out the door. Its chaotic and hard to understand how
      it all works. <br><br>A few notes that might help you:<br><br>-You take a ticket
      and go to the counter to order your food from the men making it or sit down
      at a Waiter Table.<br>-Tables against the wall are Waiter Service Only, tables
      in the middle are Self Serve meaning you order at the counter then sit down.
      <br>-The front door register is cash only. If you&#39;re paying with a card,
      pay at the back register.<br><br>This is a no frills cafeteria style diner with
      high prices, rushed orders and wet school lunch trays. The French fries were
      ok. <br><br>We take out of town relatives here because they&#39;ve heard of
      it and they want to go but we never go outside of that.

      aren&#39;t what you&#39;d expect.  It feels like a huge waste to assume 4 people
      want a pile of pickles. <br><br>The babes enjoyed the roast beef on their sandwich
      but the bread that came with our sandwiches was not worth the $20+ price of
      them. <br><br>I would recommend splitting a sandwich and seeking out a salad
      elsewhere to offset the insane pile of meat.  <br><br>The latkes were super
      thick and filling and large (and I enjoyed the flavor), but too cooked for my
      mom&#39;s taste and didn&#39;t come with enough sauce and sour cream. <br><br>I

      there was no line outside and only a 20-minute wait for table service.  The
      alternative was a wait to order in one of the many sandwich lines and then seat
      ourselves in the communal seating areas. Oh yeah, there&#39;s two big security
      guards at the door on the way in and out.  One gives you a pink ticket on the
      way in that gets marked once you&#39;ve paid for your meal, the other checks
      to see if said ticket is marked on the way out. Also, don&#39;t lose the ticket
      or it will cost you a pretty penny in fees on the way out.  You could argue
      with them like I saw a family doing when I came in, but by the looks of the
      security gaurds, I wouldn&#39;t want any smoke with them.<br><br>Anyways, the
      food was fabulous.  The pastrami was amazing. It literally melts in your mouth
      and was everything with a side of mayonnaise. The matzo ball soup was delicious
      as well, it was my first time having it and I was impressed. I also dig that
      this place makes its own lemonade.  Moreover, Katz is pretty pricey but the

      frankfurters and pastrami on rye to share. My favourite is the Pastrami on Rye.
      Expensive but worth every cent. Comes with two types of pickles too.. definitely
      plenty to share between two. <br><br>Each adults are given a green ticket each
      so they can figure out what you have ordered. If you are paying by card then
      pay at the back corner, right hand side. Cash is taken at the entrance of the
      restaurant. Green tickets are checked before you exit to make sure you are all
      settled with all the charges. <br><br>People are also given the choice of self
      service vs. full service tables. I opted for the self service option given it
      was pretty early and there were tables readily available. <br><br>Left just
      a little bit over 12:30pm and there wasn&#39;t a queue outside. Four frankfurters

    :body: Katz&#39;s is a very popular Lower East Side deli. They&#39;re famous for
      their large meat sandwiches. Ive heard several people say its the best corned
      beefed/or rueben they&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;m not a huge meat eater so I usually
      get fries and a soda. <br><br>Extremely popular with tourists, this place is
      always packed with a line out the door. Its chaotic and hard to understand how
      it all works. <br><br>A few notes that might help you:<br><br>-You take a ticket
      and go to the counter to order your food from the men making it or sit down
      at a Waiter Table.<br>-Tables against the wall are Waiter Service Only, tables
      in the middle are Self Serve meaning you order at the counter then sit down.
      <br>-The front door register is cash only. If you&#39;re paying with a card,
      pay at the back register.<br><br>This is a no frills cafeteria style diner with
      high prices, rushed orders and wet school lunch trays. The French fries were
      ok. <br><br>We take out of town relatives here because they&#39;ve heard of
      it and they want to go but we never go outside of that.

    :body: This place stays busy, I hear about it all the time but never got around

      there was no line outside and only a 20-minute wait for table service.  The
      alternative was a wait to order in one of the many sandwich lines and then seat
      ourselves in the communal seating areas. Oh yeah, there&#39;s two big security
      guards at the door on the way in and out.  One gives you a pink ticket on the
      way in that gets marked once you&#39;ve paid for your meal, the other checks
      to see if said ticket is marked on the way out. Also, don&#39;t lose the ticket
      or it will cost you a pretty penny in fees on the way out.  You could argue
      with them like I saw a family doing when I came in, but by the looks of the
      security gaurds, I wouldn&#39;t want any smoke with them.<br><br>Anyways, the
      food was fabulous.  The pastrami was amazing. It literally melts in your mouth
      and was everything with a side of mayonnaise. The matzo ball soup was delicious
      as well, it was my first time having it and I was impressed. I also dig that
      this place makes its own lemonade.  Moreover, Katz is pretty pricey but the
      food and the experience are worth it.<br><br>All in all, I can finally say that

    :comment: Frankfurter
    :body: Got here just before the Sat tourist lunch rush circa 11:40am. Ordered
      frankfurters and pastrami on rye to share. My favourite is the Pastrami on Rye.
      Expensive but worth every cent. Comes with two types of pickles too.. definitely
      plenty to share between two. <br><br>Each adults are given a green ticket each
      so they can figure out what you have ordered. If you are paying by card then
      pay at the back corner, right hand side. Cash is taken at the entrance of the
      restaurant. Green tickets are checked before you exit to make sure you are all
      settled with all the charges. <br><br>People are also given the choice of self
      service vs. full service tables. I opted for the self service option given it
      was pretty early and there were tables readily available. <br><br>Left just
      a little bit over 12:30pm and there wasn&#39;t a queue outside. Four frankfurters
      and a pastrami on rye ended up just a tad over $50.

  - :body: Hooray For Dendur!<br><br>Today, I think I experienced a miracle. Let me
      tell you a little bit of backstory first, though. I have been running all over
      town buying C B D products for my wife, Wanda. She has been in what the doctors
      are calling a &#34;rapidly deteriorating condition&#34; for one wee3k now. I
      was trying to keep her awake by playing old episodes of American Gladiator,
      her favorite show, but she has been sleeping for the past two days now. Finally,
      I got her up and gave her another CBD infused olive shake, which got her a little
      nergized. I asked her &#34;Wanda is there anything you want to do now before
      it&#39;s too late?&#34; she told me &#34;yes&#34; and &#34;I want to go to the
      Met Museum to see the Dendur Temple. &#34; My eyes got wide as saucers. But
      of course I said &#34;yes.&#34; So I loaded her up in the car and got her caretaker&#39;s
      approval and we zoomed off to Cendtral PArk. <br>Okay, back to the main point.
      But first, one small complaint. The staff at the museum told my wife she wasn&#39;t
      following the dress code because she was wearing her hospice gown. They said
      she would have to cover up if she wanted to come in the museum. But I gave them
      a piece of my mind! But then I had to go to the bathroom. When I got back there
      was a whole crowd of young people taking pictures of her on their Smart Phones.
      They all asked me some questions about the Camp exhibit and I told them this
      isn&#39;t Camp, kids, its the Metropolitan Museum of Art! Kids these days are
      really idiots. Anyway, the guard figured out that Wanda was coming into the
      museum one way or the other so they let us through.<br>We got to the Dendur
      Temple and I rolled my Wanda right on past the line and straight into that temple
      gate. Then all the sudden she starts moaning. The guards asked me sir is your
      wife alright? And she was thrashing and said &#34;O Horus!!&#34; I said &#34;Wanda
      did I give you too much CBD?&#34; Then she sat straight up and looked in my
      eyes and said , &#34; My Husband, I am healed!&#34; Needless to say, I will
      be coming back to the Metropolitan Museum and to the Dendur Temple many many
      more times!! Would recommend to anyone who needs  a little &#39;Pick me Up!&#34;

      ones in the world, and the Met ranks right up there.  <br><br>It&#39;s so easy
      to get lost inside, but that&#39;s kinda what makes it fun.<br><br>They&#39;ve
      got a diverse collection, and you&#39;ll need several trips to really just be
      able to walk and look through a fraction of it.<br><br>Saw the Camp exhibit,

  - :body: A review long overdue, considering I&#39;ve been here upwards of ten times
      over the quarter century I&#39;ve been living in New York! They restructured
      the whole place a few years ago, so the layout makes a lot more sense and is
      a lot easier to navigate. My favorite permanent section is the European painting
      section on the second floor, which houses many excellent and well-labeled pieces
      by Monet, Van Gogh, and Pissarro. The Egyptian section is also excellent and
      is as good as the Egyptian Museum in Egypt. They also have a yearly fashion
      exhibit (China Through the Looking Glass a few years ago, Camp this year) that
      is well curated and well attended. Since it&#39;s one of the world&#39;s best
      museums, it can get pretty crowded, especially on weekends. You can spend the
      whole day here and still not finish seeing everything.

      the rooftop does close so check for the times or ask someone! They will know.
      <br><br>Please spend the time inside the museum and look for things you would
      like to see. This place was amazingly beautiful everywhere but I still had my
      favorites which was going on top of the roof. <br><br>Tip- You aren&#39;t allowed
      to take video just photos when you get on top!

      tourists, they just make it significantly harder to bike and run in the park).
      <br><br>That aside, central park is a haven: lakes, expansive green spaces,
      softball fields, playgrounds, gazebos, 6+ miles of running loops and bike paths,
      etc. etc. Central park is wonderful as a spot for a picnic or a place for your
      dog to make friends, and equally as wonderful for reading on a bench or playing
      a game of spike ball. <br><br>Manhattan would not be the same place if not for

      prettiness is still there, the cherry blossoms were blooming at the time so

      If you are too tired to walk you can get a guy to bike you around, or a horse

    :body: I don&#39;t go into NYC very often, but going into Central Park is always
      a great respite from the craziness in the streets. The park is huge for being
      in the heart of a city and there&#39;s so much space to just to what you want
      to do. <br><br>We walked to the park a couple weeks ago after an early dinner
      and while we weren&#39;t there very long it was nice to get a short walk in
      after a big meal. My only negative while in the park was the smell of pot everywhere.
      I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not like that throughout the whole park, but where we
      were it was really annoying.

      come here a few times and I&#39;d probably say that this place has one of the
      best cream puffs &amp; desserts in Manhattan. <br><br>The line here is always
      pretty long but it moves pretty quickly. It&#39;s kind of a grab and go kind
      of place but there is seating inside and a long bench outside to sit as well.
      Seating is a little difficult so be prepared to stand around before finding
      a seat. Their service is really good as well in my opinion. If your drink isn&#39;t
      sweet enough they will make it a little sweeter for you. If you flat out don&#39;t
      like the drink you got, you can kindly ask them to switch it for you. I would
      however recommend being cautious about doing it because it is up to them if
      they want to do it or not. You also don&#39;t want to take advantage of their
      service and do it all the time. So if there is nothing wrong with your drink
      and you dont hate it, just drink it. <br><br>We had: <br>Black Sesame Creampuff:
      super creamy and delicious! You really taste the black sesame as you can see.
      I would probably say that this is my favorite flavor out of all the ones I had.
      <br><br>Matcha Creampuff: super standard in my opinion. Matcha is always the
      safe way to go. I would recommend getting this if it&#39;s your first time getting
      a Creampuff or if it your first time coming here and you like matcha. <br><br>Earl
      Grey Creampuff: this one was my second favorite one! There is so much depth
      if the flavors that you really get a tea flavor. I always have to get one of
      these whenever I stop by if they still have it that is. <br><br>Passionfruit
      Jasmine Tea: this can be a little underwhelming. It&#39;s not very sweet so
      I had to ask them to adjust the sweetness level which they kindly did for me!
      This had a very strong tea profile so all you tea lovers would appreciate it!
      <br><br>Valentine&#39;s Day Macaroons: super cute set! They only had a limited
      supply and you had to preorder it from them. All of their Macaroons were hand
      made so you can see the love and time poured into it! My boo got these for me!!!<br><br>Year
      of the Pig Macaroons: this was super cute! The pig cake was also a limited edition
      macaroon and very delicious! If you can get your hand on their macaroons, I
      guarantee you won&#39;t be disappointed! <br><br>Creampuff are usually pretty
      big so I recommend going with a buddy or another person and try different flavors.
      You can never really tell if a place is good if you only get one thing from
      there. If you are visiting New York for the first time and around Time Square,
      definitely stop by for dessert/snack! <br><br>Check out my Instagram page for

      is a hard pill to swallow when you approach, but just accept that as a sign
      that this place really does live up to the hype. They have a varied menu of
      coffees, teas, cakes, scones, and sandwiches, so just use the time on the line
      to determine what you want. If you&#39;re a latte lover like me, you&#39;ll
      enjoy their interesting flavors, like lavender and jasmine. I went with a regular
      large almond milk latte, because that&#39;s what I get enough to be able to
      distinguish the quality in a new place; I definitely think they make one of
      the best lattes I&#39;ve had in quite some time, if not the best. It&#39;s so
      consistently smooth, and not just the first foamy layer. You get a very big
      portion for the price, too ($5). I was so satisfied. I want to know their secrets!
      <br><br>Their matcha cakes and scones seem to be very popular. <br><br>They
      have a loyalty card by the cashier. <br><br>It&#39;s very loud and crowded here,
      so don&#39;t come for work or reading. It feels touristy, which makes for good
      people-watching. Be prepared to hunt for seats. Also, there&#39;s a bathroom,
      which is rare for Theater District cafes.

      quickly even when the line is to the door. <br><br>Their pastries on display
      are all very cute and many are alpaca themed. I couldn&#39;t restrain myself
      from taking pictures of the cakes and macarons while waiting in line. I tried
      their black sesame croissant, earl grey cream puff, and matcha jasmine iced
      latte with soy milk. <br><br>- Black Sesame Croissant: The brown and black stripes
      are very photogenic, but I thought the flavor was okay. Imagine an almond croissant
      with grounded black sesame mixed with the filling. I thought the sesame flavor
      was a little underwhelming and made the filling unsweet. I wished it was sweeter
      because that&#39;s what makes an almond croissant yummy. <br><br>- Earl Grey
      Cream Puff: An absolute must try! I love that the outside is crunchy and not
      that sweet, which balances out with the sweet, refreshing tea cream that oozes
      out when I bite into the puff. At first I thought I&#39;d save half for the
      next day, but it was so good that I finished it all. I really like Beard Papa,
      but Bibble &amp; Sip&#39;s style of cream puff looks different. After having
      this earl grey flavor, I&#39;m more tempted to get Bibble &amp; Sip if only
      they were in the West Coast.<br><br>- Matcha Jasmine Latte: I got this on both
      visits. You can taste both flavors of 2 of the most caffeinated Asian teas!
      Yay! The sweetness is not overpowering either. I think this drink is alway a
      safe choice to get as long as you like both matcha and jasmine. It&#39;s not
      as unique as their cream puffs. <br><br>Overall, foods are high quality and
      very photogenic. It&#39;s most expensive than Starbucks but I would choose here

      ordered a Black Sesame Hazelnut Mousse Cake cream puff, Matcha White Chocolate

      that these freshly baked cream puffs wouldn&#39;t have a lot of filling and
      start to stale. But I was completely wrong - they have SO much filling, I frickin
      loved it. Bread was also soft (probably due to the filling sitting in) it was
      really easy to eat. <br><br>One thing to point out is that these fillings are
      most likely handmade by the employees, because I noticed the texture of the
      Black Sesame cream puff was creamy as to what I had expected but the Matcha
      cream puff&#39;s filling was extremely liquidy, making it hard to eat - or maybe
      it could be based on the ingredients. But either way they were both very delicious
      and met up to my expectations.<br><br>The alpaca macaron had a matcha and dark
      chocolate filling - two of my favs, so I inhaled that in two seconds so I don&#39;t

      come here a few times and I&#39;d probably say that this place has one of the
      best cream puffs &amp; desserts in Manhattan. <br><br>The line here is always
      pretty long but it moves pretty quickly. It&#39;s kind of a grab and go kind
      of place but there is seating inside and a long bench outside to sit as well.
      Seating is a little difficult so be prepared to stand around before finding
      a seat. Their service is really good as well in my opinion. If your drink isn&#39;t
      sweet enough they will make it a little sweeter for you. If you flat out don&#39;t
      like the drink you got, you can kindly ask them to switch it for you. I would
      however recommend being cautious about doing it because it is up to them if
      they want to do it or not. You also don&#39;t want to take advantage of their
      service and do it all the time. So if there is nothing wrong with your drink
      and you dont hate it, just drink it. <br><br>We had: <br>Black Sesame Creampuff:
      super creamy and delicious! You really taste the black sesame as you can see.
      I would probably say that this is my favorite flavor out of all the ones I had.
      <br><br>Matcha Creampuff: super standard in my opinion. Matcha is always the
      safe way to go. I would recommend getting this if it&#39;s your first time getting
      a Creampuff or if it your first time coming here and you like matcha. <br><br>Earl
      Grey Creampuff: this one was my second favorite one! There is so much depth
      if the flavors that you really get a tea flavor. I always have to get one of
      these whenever I stop by if they still have it that is. <br><br>Passionfruit
      Jasmine Tea: this can be a little underwhelming. It&#39;s not very sweet so
      I had to ask them to adjust the sweetness level which they kindly did for me!
      This had a very strong tea profile so all you tea lovers would appreciate it!
      <br><br>Valentine&#39;s Day Macaroons: super cute set! They only had a limited
      supply and you had to preorder it from them. All of their Macaroons were hand
      made so you can see the love and time poured into it! My boo got these for me!!!<br><br>Year
      of the Pig Macaroons: this was super cute! The pig cake was also a limited edition
      macaroon and very delicious! If you can get your hand on their macaroons, I
      guarantee you won&#39;t be disappointed! <br><br>Creampuff are usually pretty
      big so I recommend going with a buddy or another person and try different flavors.
      You can never really tell if a place is good if you only get one thing from
      there. If you are visiting New York for the first time and around Time Square,
      definitely stop by for dessert/snack! <br><br>Check out my Instagram page for

      is a hard pill to swallow when you approach, but just accept that as a sign
      that this place really does live up to the hype. They have a varied menu of
      coffees, teas, cakes, scones, and sandwiches, so just use the time on the line
      to determine what you want. If you&#39;re a latte lover like me, you&#39;ll
      enjoy their interesting flavors, like lavender and jasmine. I went with a regular
      large almond milk latte, because that&#39;s what I get enough to be able to
      distinguish the quality in a new place; I definitely think they make one of
      the best lattes I&#39;ve had in quite some time, if not the best. It&#39;s so
      consistently smooth, and not just the first foamy layer. You get a very big
      portion for the price, too ($5). I was so satisfied. I want to know their secrets!
      <br><br>Their matcha cakes and scones seem to be very popular. <br><br>They
      have a loyalty card by the cashier. <br><br>It&#39;s very loud and crowded here,
      so don&#39;t come for work or reading. It feels touristy, which makes for good
      people-watching. Be prepared to hunt for seats. Also, there&#39;s a bathroom,
      which is rare for Theater District cafes.

      are all very cute and many are alpaca themed. I couldn&#39;t restrain myself
      from taking pictures of the cakes and macarons while waiting in line. I tried
      their black sesame croissant, earl grey cream puff, and matcha jasmine iced
      latte with soy milk. <br><br>- Black Sesame Croissant: The brown and black stripes
      are very photogenic, but I thought the flavor was okay. Imagine an almond croissant
      with grounded black sesame mixed with the filling. I thought the sesame flavor
      was a little underwhelming and made the filling unsweet. I wished it was sweeter
      because that&#39;s what makes an almond croissant yummy. <br><br>- Earl Grey
      Cream Puff: An absolute must try! I love that the outside is crunchy and not
      that sweet, which balances out with the sweet, refreshing tea cream that oozes
      out when I bite into the puff. At first I thought I&#39;d save half for the
      next day, but it was so good that I finished it all. I really like Beard Papa,
      but Bibble &amp; Sip&#39;s style of cream puff looks different. After having
      this earl grey flavor, I&#39;m more tempted to get Bibble &amp; Sip if only
      they were in the West Coast.<br><br>- Matcha Jasmine Latte: I got this on both
      visits. You can taste both flavors of 2 of the most caffeinated Asian teas!
      Yay! The sweetness is not overpowering either. I think this drink is alway a
      safe choice to get as long as you like both matcha and jasmine. It&#39;s not
      as unique as their cream puffs. <br><br>Overall, foods are high quality and
      very photogenic. It&#39;s most expensive than Starbucks but I would choose here
      every time.'

    :body: I enjoyed the cookies and cream cream puff. Feels like I mistyped that
      after typing cream twice. So nice they named it twice! <br><br>Anyway, I thought
      it was tasty and fairly priced! (Approx $4). The staff was nice and the atmosphere
      was cozy. I will try more cream puff flavors in the future. <br><br>I also tried
      their earl grey panna cotta which I wasn&#39;t a fan of. Just not my thing but

      after typing cream twice. So nice they named it twice! <br><br>Anyway, I thought
      it was tasty and fairly priced! (Approx $4). The staff was nice and the atmosphere
      was cozy. I will try more cream puff flavors in the future. <br><br>I also tried
      their earl grey panna cotta which I wasn&#39;t a fan of. Just not my thing but

      was also adorable. After spending a long time taking pictures, she finally ate
      it. It was really good!<br><br>Last time when I came, I also got a earl grey
      pinna cotta. It was in a cute little glass container with an alpaca on it. It

      The flavor was good, not too sweet. It was a great treat on a Friday afternoon.<br><br>My
      only two issues are, the creme puffs are not served until 12. Please wake up
      early and bake! You are a bakery, that means early hours.  Also seating is limited,

      here before heading to Gershwin. I love that this place is across the street
      and although packed and busy, there wasn&#39;t a line. <br><br>I really wanted
      to try the black sesame cream puff but it was gone by EoD. So I tried the earl
      grey cream puff. It was light fluffy creamy and cold. Best cream puff I have
      had in my life? Probably yes. But it did not change my life. <br><br>The soft
      serve like filling oozes out with a bite. And on a hot day it felt refreshing.
      And the flaky layer melts away in your mouth. The flavor is pretty light but
      as described unmistakably earl grey.  <br><br>Delicious but quite forgettable.
      Maybe, I will try something else the next time I am there.

      Coast (Native Californian ‍)<br><br>I&#39;ve had the carne Asada and the pork
      adobada. Both are good but the pork wins hands down. Tacos come on a regular
      tortilla BUT you can up your taco game with a cheese shell!! Ooey, greasy and
      so delicious. I highly recommend going for the cheese shell.<br><br>As you go
      down the line, you&#39;ll get to the salsa section where everything tastes great.
      But you should ask the servers for salsa ranchera (they don&#39;t leave that
      out) which is even better than the ones you see in the bowls. It has a spicy/charred
      flavor that goes well with the fresh meat.<br><br>The one con is that because
      it&#39;s so good/popular, it&#39;s really crowded so you&#39;ll need to grab
      your plate and some napkins and stand somewhere else in Chelsea Market to eat.

      gonna have &#34;legit&#34; tacos in NYC. <br><br>I ordered a carne asada taco
      and an adobada taco (al pastor) and then went through the process. You get your
      ticket, you take it to the taquero, and you tell him whether you want corn or
      flour. Amidst all the crazy hustle and bustle you wait while they make your
      tacos. These take a little bit longer than normal street tacos because the tortillas
      are being made on the spot. Honestly as great as all the ingredients were, it
      was the tortillas that won me over. <br><br>The only thing I would say is that
      they seemed a little expensive, but I also live in a region where tacos are
      everywhere and cost about $1-1.50. Im sure for being located inside Chelsea
      Market, $3-3.50/taco is probably not a bad price. <br><br>So, all this to say

      order, give the receipt to any guy who is available behind the counter, and
      that guy will make your order. <br>I got steak taco and pork quesadilla. Oh

  - :body: NY doesn&#39;t have as big as a taco/Mexican food scene as LA does. I think
      Los Tacos is the best as taco joints come by here in NYC. Usually when people
      ask me where to grab the best tacos place in the city, I direct them to Los
      Tacos. There is a line here no matter what time of day you come due to the popularity
      of this place and Chelsea Market in general. <br><br>I would usually grab one
      of each taco offered on the menu (grilled steak, grilled chicken, marinated
      pork and grilled cactus) with a corn tortilla.  Each taco is overloaded with
      flavor and is extremely juicy. The meats are also marinated wonderfully and
      is full of spice if you order them with everything (onions, cilantro, guac and
      salsa.) <br><br>Overall, I&#39;ve been to Los Tacos countless times already
      and I keep finding myself back here whenever I&#39;m Chelsea Market. The line
      may seem a bit intimidating at first, but rest assure it moves at a decently
      fast pace. Definitely add the roasted chili peppers provided at the condiments
      station if you&#39;re a big fan of spice!

  - :body: This might just be some of the best meat tacos I have ever have. Coming
      from Southern California I was afraid that I would not be able to get my taco
      fix ever again. I was wrong. This place just introduced me to another level.
      Let&#39;s start off with the location. The Chelsea Market is a hot spot for
      a bunch of restaurants and cool sites to see. Los Tacos No. 1 is around the
      middle on the first floor and you can usually find it by locating a long line
      of people. The wait isn&#39;t bad at all but you could smell the delicious meats
      being cooked and the sound of all that carne asada hitting the grill makes your
      mouth water as you approach the counter. <br><br>I tried a carne asada and adobada
      taco (I was saving space in my stomach for more food in Chelsea Market) with
      everything on it and on corn tortillas. They have some nice sauces on the counter
      which just enhance the flavors of the tacos so don&#39;t miss out on them. After
      picking up your tacos at the counter, you make your trek through the market
      to locate a nice and secure spot to munch on you steaming fresh tacos (Don&#39;t
      forget the napkins!). When I took my first bite into the adobada I knew this
      place was something else. The fatty and juicy pork just lit up fireworks all
      over my taste buds exploding me into a flavor overload as the salsa, onions,
      cilantro, and guacamole combine with the meat for one of the best things I have
      tasted in a while. I continue to bite and bite and without any left, I felt
      a bit of sadness, yet massive excitement for the carne asada. I was not disappointed
      and scarfed it down just as fast. The only regret I really had is that I saved
      room and didn&#39;t order more tacos. But if anything this craving will cause
      me to come back here as soon as possible for these amazing tacos.<br><br>The
      only issue I had with the place was the slight disorganization with the taco
      pick up. I think that it is a result of how busy it can get there but the system
      is just a bit hectic when you have a bunch of hungry people waiting for their
      tacos. It was no problem at all really. So stop reading this review and try
      this place already!

    :comment: Pork taco on the left and carne taco on top. Both with the cheese shell.
    :body: Los Tacos No. 1 is as good as any taco place I&#39;ve eaten at on the West
      Coast (Native Californian ‍)<br><br>I&#39;ve had the carne Asada and the pork
      adobada. Both are good but the pork wins hands down. Tacos come on a regular
      tortilla BUT you can up your taco game with a cheese shell!! Ooey, greasy and
      so delicious. I highly recommend going for the cheese shell.<br><br>As you go
      down the line, you&#39;ll get to the salsa section where everything tastes great.
      But you should ask the servers for salsa ranchera (they don&#39;t leave that
      out) which is even better than the ones you see in the bowls. It has a spicy/charred
      flavor that goes well with the fresh meat.<br><br>The one con is that because
      it&#39;s so good/popular, it&#39;s really crowded so you&#39;ll need to grab
      your plate and some napkins and stand somewhere else in Chelsea Market to eat.

      or the egg/salsa/guacamole combination my husband had both days.    The only

  - :body: Probably one of my favorite breakfast bagel sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had.
      When you walk in, it may look like a long line, but a lot of people are just
      standing towards the front of the store either looking at the menu or waiting
      for their food to come out. To order, you have to walk all the way towards the
      back of the store towards the register there. They give you a receipt which
      you then bring to the register towards the front of the store (where they&#39;re
      distributing the food) in order to pay.. doesn&#39;t seem too efficient and
      like it&#39;s an extra step but hey, it&#39;s not my business.<br><br>I got
      the Taylor ham and egg breakfast sandwich on an Everything Whole Wheat bagel.
      I don&#39;t know how they make these bagels, but they were SO. CHEWY. I loved
      the texture. It had a firmness to it but was still very chewy and easy to eat.
      I&#39;ve never had a bagel with this type of texture before. And don&#39;t be
      fooled by the size. It may look like a regular old, small bagel sandwich but
      this thing filled me up!! I was very satisfied with my breakfast and it just
      may have been the best bagel I&#39;ve had thus far.

      a confident title, I expected no less than the best. The line here is pretty
      long, and it was kind of confusing since there were two lines going on. I&#39;m
      still mildly confused to be honest, but at the end of the day, I got my coffee
      and bagel so that&#39;s all that matters. Seats are pretty limited here and
      get snatched up the moment someone gets up. Luckily, a table cleared while we
      were waiting. Most people ordered and left to go about their day.<br><br>After
      some time, I got my sesame bagel lox sandwich. This sandwich was loaded with
      a good amount of cream cheese, smoked salmon, lettuce, tomatoes and onions.
      Yum! This bagel&#39;wich left quite the impression and I was pleased. I didn&#39;t
      expect the bagel&#39;wich to be so filling. I wasn&#39;t even halfway done and
      I was ready to call it quits. Come with an empty stomach if you&#39;re looking
      to eat the whole thing! Another thing, the name of the store is Best Bagel &amp;

    :body: Probably one of my favorite breakfast bagel sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had.
      When you walk in, it may look like a long line, but a lot of people are just
      standing towards the front of the store either looking at the menu or waiting
      for their food to come out. To order, you have to walk all the way towards the
      back of the store towards the register there. They give you a receipt which
      you then bring to the register towards the front of the store (where they&#39;re
      distributing the food) in order to pay.. doesn&#39;t seem too efficient and
      like it&#39;s an extra step but hey, it&#39;s not my business.<br><br>I got
      the Taylor ham and egg breakfast sandwich on an Everything Whole Wheat bagel.
      I don&#39;t know how they make these bagels, but they were SO. CHEWY. I loved
      the texture. It had a firmness to it but was still very chewy and easy to eat.
      I&#39;ve never had a bagel with this type of texture before. And don&#39;t be
      fooled by the size. It may look like a regular old, small bagel sandwich but
      this thing filled me up!! I was very satisfied with my breakfast and it just
      may have been the best bagel I&#39;ve had thus far.

      Shake Shack. <br><br>I love the absolute plethora of seating and they don&#39;t
      monitor it at all so it&#39;s up for grabs for any and all park goers. I love
      the little twinkle lights (everyone loves twinkle lights). I love that you just
      need to go 20 minutes before noon to beat the lunch rush. I love that the staff
      handed out samples of their milkshake when I got lunch there today. I love that
      you get a little beeper to know when your food is ready so you don&#39;t have
      too stand around the window waiting to hear your number. Love those crispy chicken
      bites with honey mustard sauce. I do not really love the burgers here (plz no
      hate mail) but I whole heartedly vouch for the chicken bites. Loveeeee that
      they serve alcohol and breakfast (not at the same time (I don&#39;t think...))
      Love that they have GF and Veggie options for my diet restricted frands. <br><br>Is
      it overpriced? Yeah. Can you get a better burger? For sure. But it&#39;s a great
      little place to eat lunch when the weather is nice. If you plan it right, you
      won&#39;t have to wait in the infamous line and you will get a table no matter
      how many people you are sitting with. <br><br>Sometimes, when the weather is

      had not been delivered. So it took about 25 minutes to get two custards which

      been gone for 3 years) I&#39;m sad to say that I couldn&#39;t give them 5 stars.
      Why? Well, I was there literally when they had the shortest line I&#39;ve ever
      seen and my bacon cheese fries came out a bit sloppy. The curly fries were okay,
      not as great as before (many years ago) and the bacons tasted like more than
      a day old that had been repeatedly reheated. They were also super chewy. The
      tables were dirty like usuals, but I didn&#39;t care much for that since I carried
      Kleenex around and I could wipe it myself. But if the food tastes kinda off,
      yup, we have a problem! <br><br>Luckily, their burger tasted the same. My chocolate

  - :body: CASH ONLY FOR DAYTIME!!  My friends and I decided to check out Clinton
      Street Baking Company around 10am on a Friday.  For some reason, the Yelp waitlist
      was not working.  When we got there, the hostess told us it was a 20 minute
      wait, but we only ended up waiting about 10 minutes.  The interior is small
      for a popular brunch place and is like a trendy, upscale diner.  <br><br>We
      ordered the country breakfast (eggs, ham, hash brown, biscuit) ($15) and substituted
      the ham for bacon, blueberry pancakes ($15), and chicken and waffles ($17).  I
      personally would not get the country breakfast again.  Eggs were way too buttery,
      the hash brown was not seasoned well and was pretty much just a lump of potato,
      and the biscuit was also bland and dry.  The sugar cured bacon was sinfully
      delicious, but was also on the heavier side.  The fried chicken was on the drier
      side but the seasoning on the chicken was fantastic.  The menu advertises a
      crispy waffle, but the waffle was soft.  The soft waffle is more my preference,
      so I did not mind.  The blueberry pancakes were amazing.  They are one of the
      best pancakes I&#39;ve had in my life.  They were fluffy, moist, and had great
      blueberry flavor without tasting artificial.  We all agreed the maple butter
      was good, but the pancakes could stand on their own.  <br><br>Service here is
      bad.  I don&#39;t know if it was just an off-day, but it seemed like the one
      host was also doubling as the only server.  There were also 2 bussers who did
      not really refill water or bring us extra plates when we asked.  For a restaurant
      this popular, there should be more people on staff.  The slow service also probably
      contributes to a longer wait time.  Although I think the menu items here are
      overpriced, I honestly believe the pancakes are worth every bit of the $15 and
      could eat them over and over again.

  - :body: I was worried this popular breakfast/brunch spot was overhyped - I was
      wrong. It is rightfully hyped. Although the dishes aren&#39;t inventive or creatively
      new (standard brunch fare like blueberry pancakes, chicken &amp; waffles, and
      eggs Benedict), everything is prepared perfectly and with high quality ingredients.
      The ingredients make all the difference - the ham on the eggs Benedict was thick
      and juicy, no large slivers of fat to cut off. The pancakes were light and fluffy
      with a perfect not-too-sweet blueberry compote and rich maple butter syrup.
      Even the side salad was perfectly dressed with a light vinaigrette. I really
      enjoyed breakfast here, and service at the bar was friendly and quick!

      do yourself a favor and come here and order the blueberry pancakes. The syrup
      that came with the pancakes tasted like butter, but don&#39;t let that steer
      you away. It was like butter and caramel mixed together and honestly... it was
      sooo good, I could&#39;ve drank it on its own. <br><br>Would definitely recommend

      30 minute, which wasn&#39;t actually that bad. I got their pancakes with banana
      and walnuts while my friend got their fried chicken &amp; waffles. <br><br>I&#39;m
      usually a savory person for brunch, so getting something sweet was the first
      time in a while. Even though I&#39;m not a huge fan of pancakes, I have to say
      these are one of the best ones I&#39;ve tried. These pancakes were so fluffy,
      warm, and went perfectly with the warm maple butter. <br><br>The buttermilk
      fried chicken &amp; waffles was great but it wasn&#39;t as good as the pancakes.
      I was more satisfied with the pancakes than the waffles, which probably explains
      why this place is known for those. <br><br>This is THE place if you love pancakes
      for brunch. There&#39;s always going to be a long wait so come prepared, but
      if you are flexible, you can also come here for dinner to avoid less people
      and still get the pancakes!

    :comment: "$17: Fried Chicken and Waffle"
    :body: CASH ONLY FOR DAYTIME!!  My friends and I decided to check out Clinton
      Street Baking Company around 10am on a Friday.  For some reason, the Yelp waitlist
      was not working.  When we got there, the hostess told us it was a 20 minute
      wait, but we only ended up waiting about 10 minutes.  The interior is small
      for a popular brunch place and is like a trendy, upscale diner.  <br><br>We
      ordered the country breakfast (eggs, ham, hash brown, biscuit) ($15) and substituted
      the ham for bacon, blueberry pancakes ($15), and chicken and waffles ($17).  I
      personally would not get the country breakfast again.  Eggs were way too buttery,
      the hash brown was not seasoned well and was pretty much just a lump of potato,
      and the biscuit was also bland and dry.  The sugar cured bacon was sinfully
      delicious, but was also on the heavier side.  The fried chicken was on the drier
      side but the seasoning on the chicken was fantastic.  The menu advertises a
      crispy waffle, but the waffle was soft.  The soft waffle is more my preference,
      so I did not mind.  The blueberry pancakes were amazing.  They are one of the
      best pancakes I&#39;ve had in my life.  They were fluffy, moist, and had great
      blueberry flavor without tasting artificial.  We all agreed the maple butter
      was good, but the pancakes could stand on their own.  <br><br>Service here is
      bad.  I don&#39;t know if it was just an off-day, but it seemed like the one
      host was also doubling as the only server.  There were also 2 bussers who did
      not really refill water or bring us extra plates when we asked.  For a restaurant
      this popular, there should be more people on staff.  The slow service also probably
      contributes to a longer wait time.  Although I think the menu items here are
      overpriced, I honestly believe the pancakes are worth every bit of the $15 and
      could eat them over and over again.

      with a perfect not-too-sweet blueberry compote and rich maple butter syrup.

    :body: My friend and I came here on a sunday for brunch and we waited for around
      30 minute, which wasn&#39;t actually that bad. I got their pancakes with banana
      and walnuts while my friend got their fried chicken &amp; waffles. <br><br>I&#39;m
      usually a savory person for brunch, so getting something sweet was the first
      time in a while. Even though I&#39;m not a huge fan of pancakes, I have to say
      these are one of the best ones I&#39;ve tried. These pancakes were so fluffy,
      warm, and went perfectly with the warm maple butter. <br><br>The buttermilk
      fried chicken &amp; waffles was great but it wasn&#39;t as good as the pancakes.
      I was more satisfied with the pancakes than the waffles, which probably explains
      why this place is known for those. <br><br>This is THE place if you love pancakes
      for brunch. There&#39;s always going to be a long wait so come prepared, but
      if you are flexible, you can also come here for dinner to avoid less people
      and still get the pancakes!

      table promptly to what look like the best table in the house. Center stage.
      Even my husband exclaimed a quiet &#34;wow&#34; when we arrived at the table.
      Thank you so much. I don&#39;t know how we deserved such an honor, but gladly
      we sat.    <br><br>My husband and I had the Chef&#39;s Tasting Menu accompanied
      with Wine Pairings. This was simply an exquisite dining experience capping off
      at 3 hours. Le Bernardin uses the finest local ingredients matching them with
      the freshest seafood in order to create extraordinary art cuisines. Beginning
      with the first course: Caviar Tartare. Biting into this, you can sense that
      it didn&#39;t come from an ordinary jar of caviar, but Osetra Caviar. One of
      the most prized caviar in the world. The rich, buttery flavor of these little
      pearls popping in your mouth really set the mood of what would be an evening
      of gastronomic adventure. From the caviar, we moved to Seared Langoustine next.
      Just like the caviar, I had never tasted langoustine this sweet or even remotely
      this succulent before. The most visual for me was the size of this langoustine.
      It was the size of a colossal prawn. In fact, nothing here was ordinary. Every
      course was a prelude to an even more pleasing edible work of art. Eight courses
      plus 2 additional complimentary offerings. Please (if you haven&#39;t done so)
      do scroll down and look at the pictures below.<br><br>Just like the food, the
      Wine Pairings were exceptional. The one that stood out for me the most was Krug
      Grande Cuvée 167ÈME Édition, paired with Sautéed Dover Sole. I&#39;ve seen this
      in the wine stores, but never had the pleasure of consuming it. At $180 a bottle
      in my local wine store, it&#39;s not something I would even think about buying,
      but at Le Bernardin, it&#39;s part of the Wine Pairings. I think we showed too
      much enthusiasm when the lovely Sommelier showed us the bottle and poured each
      of us a glass because she actually came back a few minutes later to pour us
      more! <br><br>Le Bernardin currently sits at # 36 on The World&#39;s 50 Best
      Restaurants. Since 2005, it has earned the coveted and well deserved 3 Michelin
      stars. Although we did not see Chef Eric Ripert that evening, we were visited
      by Ben Chekroun, Directeur de Salle, who has been here for 26 years. He came
      over to say hello and to make sure we were having a pleasant evening. His gesture
      was quite sincere. I think if one of us had said we LOVED the Krug Grande Cuvée,
      he probably would&#39;ve poured us more himself. Little touches like this really
      make a difference.  <br><br>As the evening wore on, the exceptional service
      bestowed on us, the generous pours of wine pairings from the lovely and knowledgeable
      Sommelier, and savoring these artistically plated works of art...we were in
      our own little world. There are few chefs quite as celebrated as Eric Ripert,
      and on this visit, our expectations were met on every level. Definitely worth

      tasting menu often but regardless, you will not be disappointed.<br><br>We started
      with some complimentary assortment of bread such as sun dried tomato bread,
      focaccia with olives and quinoa bread.  I loved the quinoa bread. Delicious
      with butter and had a good chew to it. <br><br>My friend and I both ordered
      the bay scallops as the starter. Thinly sliced fresh scallops. So fresh and
      clean tasting. Served with thin slices of toasted baguette. Superb. <br><br>We
      then ordered one of each for the entrée: Merluza and striped bass. Both fish
      were delicious and different which was great. Both were whitefish but the merluza
      was light and flakey while the striped bass was a bit meatier. The merluza came
      with a light consomme and shitake mushrooms on a bed of cooked down greens.
      So gooooood! It was my favorite. The striped bass was also very good, seasoned
      heavily in what seemed like smoked paprika and little bites of sweet potato.
      Loved it!<br><br>The meal ended perfectly with dessert. An assortment of super
      soft, very flavorful ice cream and sorbet as well as this citrus dish that was
      super refreshing. <br><br>Overall, a wonderful meal. The service was wonderful
      and we never felt rushed to leave. And the best part was that we saw Eric Ripert
      roaming around!!! Totally had a celebrity sighting moment and I freaked internally.'

      for some time and they have a three-course lunch menu for $90, so I thought
      I&#39;d treat myself. The restaurant feels very old-school New York style with
      wood paneling and waiters in gloves in the afternoon. The food was stunningly
      presented and the service was very formal and elegant. The food was all very
      enjoyable, but it missed 5 starts for me, because I enjoyed everything we ate,
      but it wasn&#39;t memorable. The shrimp appetizer was the stand out dish and
      the hazelnut desert was also delicious. The S&#39;mores Dessert was interesting,
      but VERY smokey. We also had a guest appearance of Eric Ripert, talking to a
      table next to us.

      of deciding when to visit. While Le Bernardin did not blow me away, the food
      was beautifully presented and tasted fresh. The staff were friendly and the
      environment was much more relaxed than the likes of Daniel, La Grenouille, etc.<br><br>We
      opted for the pre-fixe menu as I have a shellfish allergy (I know you&#39;re
      thinking, what was I doing at LeB) but I still love raw fish and at that they
      are one of the best. It must be noted that the chef makes a superb rack of lamb.
      You won&#39;t be disappointed regardless of which menu you choose as the diners
      surrounding us all appeared to enjoy their meal.<br><br>The highlight of our
      meal was actually dessert. We split the chocolate &#34;donut&#34; ganache and
      selection of four ice creams. Everything was heavenly without being too sweet.
      Lastly, I was unexpectedly presented with a complimentary mini chocolate cake
      for my bday in addition to an assortment of mini pastries. <br><br>A very positive

      evening expecting to dine with their prix-fixed menu as I had in the past, and
      the host Cesar, was appalling as he suggested we dine at the bar, despite the
      open seating available. He argued with me for 5 minutes about how he needed
      to save those tables, which never ended up committed and he let me know that
      one is for &#34;older people who need to sit while they wait for their tables.&#34;
      Amazing. <br><br>This ruined the experience and we opted to get lounge food
      instead of the main dining food and go somewhere else. We ordered their lounge
      dishes and nothing was impressive and we left shortly thereafter despite empty

      This is a seafood restaurant through and through so definitely re-consider if
      you don&#39;t love seafood. <br><br>They have 3 menu options - a four course
      dinner where you get a choice of around 10 dishes for each course, a 7 course
      tasting menu, and an 8 course tasting menu. We opted for the 4 course menu as
      we had eaten 4-5 hours prior and wanted more flexibility in our meal, but the
      tasting menus both looked amazing.<br><br>They brought out a beautiful amuse-bouche
      platter with 5 offerings on it for us before our main meal. All of them were
      unique and lovely.<br><br>We had a tuna carpaccio and kampachi sashimi for our
      starters. The tuna in particular was plated beautifully and was so pretty I
      didn&#39;t even want to eat it. The kampachi was incredibly fresh and tasty,
      and was probably the better tasting dish although the tuna looked prettier.<br><br>For
      second course, we had a crab cake made with lump peekytoe crab and lightly grilled
      pieces of cod. The crab cake was really masterful and peekytoe is a species
      of crab I had not tasted before so it was a unique experience for me. The cod
      wasn&#39;t bad but did pale in comparison to our other dishes that night.<br><br>For
      our main course, we had the snapper and walu-wagyu surf and turf combo. The
      snapper was cooked perfectly with a great sauce - really a pleasure to eat.
      The wagyu was definitely the star of the other dish - just full of flavor while
      melting in your mouth. My walu was slightly overcooked which made the outer
      edges tough, but the middle section was succulent and tasty. Would have been
      a perfect duo if the walu was cooked a bit less.<br><br>The desserts were good
      taste-wise but really stood out in their presentation. I&#39;m not really a
      dessert person but I enjoyed both.<br><br>Service was outstanding as would be
      expected in a 3 Michelin star restaurant. I highly recommend this place and
      I would come back again for sure.

    :body: 'It was a Friday night, 8 o&#39;clock reservation. We were taken to our
      table promptly to what look like the best table in the house. Center stage.
      Even my husband exclaimed a quiet &#34;wow&#34; when we arrived at the table.
      Thank you so much. I don&#39;t know how we deserved such an honor, but gladly
      we sat.    <br><br>My husband and I had the Chef&#39;s Tasting Menu accompanied
      with Wine Pairings. This was simply an exquisite dining experience capping off
      at 3 hours. Le Bernardin uses the finest local ingredients matching them with
      the freshest seafood in order to create extraordinary art cuisines. Beginning
      with the first course: Caviar Tartare. Biting into this, you can sense that
      it didn&#39;t come from an ordinary jar of caviar, but Osetra Caviar. One of
      the most prized caviar in the world. The rich, buttery flavor of these little
      pearls popping in your mouth really set the mood of what would be an evening
      of gastronomic adventure. From the caviar, we moved to Seared Langoustine next.
      Just like the caviar, I had never tasted langoustine this sweet or even remotely
      this succulent before. The most visual for me was the size of this langoustine.
      It was the size of a colossal prawn. In fact, nothing here was ordinary. Every
      course was a prelude to an even more pleasing edible work of art. Eight courses
      plus 2 additional complimentary offerings. Please (if you haven&#39;t done so)
      do scroll down and look at the pictures below.<br><br>Just like the food, the
      Wine Pairings were exceptional. The one that stood out for me the most was Krug
      Grande Cuvée 167ÈME Édition, paired with Sautéed Dover Sole. I&#39;ve seen this
      in the wine stores, but never had the pleasure of consuming it. At $180 a bottle
      in my local wine store, it&#39;s not something I would even think about buying,
      but at Le Bernardin, it&#39;s part of the Wine Pairings. I think we showed too
      much enthusiasm when the lovely Sommelier showed us the bottle and poured each
      of us a glass because she actually came back a few minutes later to pour us
      more! <br><br>Le Bernardin currently sits at # 36 on The World&#39;s 50 Best
      Restaurants. Since 2005, it has earned the coveted and well deserved 3 Michelin
      stars. Although we did not see Chef Eric Ripert that evening, we were visited
      by Ben Chekroun, Directeur de Salle, who has been here for 26 years. He came
      over to say hello and to make sure we were having a pleasant evening. His gesture
      was quite sincere. I think if one of us had said we LOVED the Krug Grande Cuvée,
      he probably would&#39;ve poured us more himself. Little touches like this really
      make a difference.  <br><br>As the evening wore on, the exceptional service
      bestowed on us, the generous pours of wine pairings from the lovely and knowledgeable
      Sommelier, and savoring these artistically plated works of art...we were in
      our own little world. There are few chefs quite as celebrated as Eric Ripert,
      and on this visit, our expectations were met on every level. Definitely worth
      the special journey.'

      at 3 hours. Le Bernardin uses the finest local ingredients matching them with
      the freshest seafood in order to create extraordinary art cuisines. Beginning
      with the first course: Caviar Tartare. Biting into this, you can sense that
      it didn&#39;t come from an ordinary jar of caviar, but Osetra Caviar. One of
      the most prized caviar in the world. The rich, buttery flavor of these little
      pearls popping in your mouth really set the mood of what would be an evening
      of gastronomic adventure. From the caviar, we moved to Seared Langoustine next.
      Just like the caviar, I had never tasted langoustine this sweet or even remotely
      this succulent before. The most visual for me was the size of this langoustine.
      It was the size of a colossal prawn. In fact, nothing here was ordinary. Every
      course was a prelude to an even more pleasing edible work of art. Eight courses
      plus 2 additional complimentary offerings. Please (if you haven&#39;t done so)
      do scroll down and look at the pictures below.<br><br>Just like the food, the
      Wine Pairings were exceptional. The one that stood out for me the most was Krug
      Grande Cuvée 167ÈME Édition, paired with Sautéed Dover Sole. I&#39;ve seen this
      in the wine stores, but never had the pleasure of consuming it. At $180 a bottle
      in my local wine store, it&#39;s not something I would even think about buying,
      but at Le Bernardin, it&#39;s part of the Wine Pairings. I think we showed too
      much enthusiasm when the lovely Sommelier showed us the bottle and poured each
      of us a glass because she actually came back a few minutes later to pour us
      more! <br><br>Le Bernardin currently sits at # 36 on The World&#39;s 50 Best
      Restaurants. Since 2005, it has earned the coveted and well deserved 3 Michelin
      stars. Although we did not see Chef Eric Ripert that evening, we were visited
      by Ben Chekroun, Directeur de Salle, who has been here for 26 years. He came
      over to say hello and to make sure we were having a pleasant evening. His gesture
      was quite sincere. I think if one of us had said we LOVED the Krug Grande Cuvée,
      he probably would&#39;ve poured us more himself. Little touches like this really
      make a difference.  <br><br>As the evening wore on, the exceptional service
      bestowed on us, the generous pours of wine pairings from the lovely and knowledgeable
      Sommelier, and savoring these artistically plated works of art...we were in
      our own little world. There are few chefs quite as celebrated as Eric Ripert,
      and on this visit, our expectations were met on every level. Definitely worth
      the special journey.'

      with butter and had a good chew to it. <br><br>My friend and I both ordered

      then ordered one of each for the entrée: Merluza and striped bass. Both fish
      were delicious and different which was great. Both were whitefish but the merluza
      was light and flakey while the striped bass was a bit meatier. The merluza came
      with a light consomme and shitake mushrooms on a bed of cooked down greens.
      So gooooood! It was my favorite. The striped bass was also very good, seasoned
      heavily in what seemed like smoked paprika and little bites of sweet potato.
      Loved it!<br><br>The meal ended perfectly with dessert. An assortment of super
      soft, very flavorful ice cream and sorbet as well as this citrus dish that was

      evening expecting to dine with their prix-fixed menu as I had in the past, and
      the host Cesar, was appalling as he suggested we dine at the bar, despite the
      open seating available. He argued with me for 5 minutes about how he needed
      to save those tables, which never ended up committed and he let me know that
      one is for &#34;older people who need to sit while they wait for their tables.&#34;
      Amazing. <br><br>This ruined the experience and we opted to get lounge food
      instead of the main dining food and go somewhere else. We ordered their lounge
      dishes and nothing was impressive and we left shortly thereafter despite empty
      seating throughout the place. Awful service. Don&#39;t bring anyone you care

    :body: We came here for our anniversary and couldn&#39;t be happier with the experience.
      This is a seafood restaurant through and through so definitely re-consider if
      you don&#39;t love seafood. <br><br>They have 3 menu options - a four course
      dinner where you get a choice of around 10 dishes for each course, a 7 course
      tasting menu, and an 8 course tasting menu. We opted for the 4 course menu as
      we had eaten 4-5 hours prior and wanted more flexibility in our meal, but the
      tasting menus both looked amazing.<br><br>They brought out a beautiful amuse-bouche
      platter with 5 offerings on it for us before our main meal. All of them were
      unique and lovely.<br><br>We had a tuna carpaccio and kampachi sashimi for our
      starters. The tuna in particular was plated beautifully and was so pretty I
      didn&#39;t even want to eat it. The kampachi was incredibly fresh and tasty,
      and was probably the better tasting dish although the tuna looked prettier.<br><br>For
      second course, we had a crab cake made with lump peekytoe crab and lightly grilled
      pieces of cod. The crab cake was really masterful and peekytoe is a species
      of crab I had not tasted before so it was a unique experience for me. The cod
      wasn&#39;t bad but did pale in comparison to our other dishes that night.<br><br>For
      our main course, we had the snapper and walu-wagyu surf and turf combo. The
      snapper was cooked perfectly with a great sauce - really a pleasure to eat.
      The wagyu was definitely the star of the other dish - just full of flavor while
      melting in your mouth. My walu was slightly overcooked which made the outer
      edges tough, but the middle section was succulent and tasty. Would have been
      a perfect duo if the walu was cooked a bit less.<br><br>The desserts were good
      taste-wise but really stood out in their presentation. I&#39;m not really a
      dessert person but I enjoyed both.<br><br>Service was outstanding as would be
      expected in a 3 Michelin star restaurant. I highly recommend this place and
      I would come back again for sure.

      tasting menus both looked amazing.<br><br>They brought out a beautiful amuse-bouche
      platter with 5 offerings on it for us before our main meal. All of them were
      unique and lovely.<br><br>We had a tuna carpaccio and kampachi sashimi for our
      starters. The tuna in particular was plated beautifully and was so pretty I
      didn&#39;t even want to eat it. The kampachi was incredibly fresh and tasty,
      and was probably the better tasting dish although the tuna looked prettier.<br><br>For
      second course, we had a crab cake made with lump peekytoe crab and lightly grilled
      pieces of cod. The crab cake was really masterful and peekytoe is a species
      of crab I had not tasted before so it was a unique experience for me. The cod
      wasn&#39;t bad but did pale in comparison to our other dishes that night.<br><br>For
      our main course, we had the snapper and walu-wagyu surf and turf combo. The
      snapper was cooked perfectly with a great sauce - really a pleasure to eat.
      The wagyu was definitely the star of the other dish - just full of flavor while
      melting in your mouth. My walu was slightly overcooked which made the outer
      edges tough, but the middle section was succulent and tasty. Would have been
      a perfect duo if the walu was cooked a bit less.<br><br>The desserts were good
      taste-wise but really stood out in their presentation. I&#39;m not really a
      dessert person but I enjoyed both.<br><br>Service was outstanding as would be
      expected in a 3 Michelin star restaurant. I highly recommend this place and
      I would come back again for sure.

    :comment: Tuna carpaccio
    :body: We came here for our anniversary and couldn&#39;t be happier with the experience.
      This is a seafood restaurant through and through so definitely re-consider if
      you don&#39;t love seafood. <br><br>They have 3 menu options - a four course
      dinner where you get a choice of around 10 dishes for each course, a 7 course
      tasting menu, and an 8 course tasting menu. We opted for the 4 course menu as
