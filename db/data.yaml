  - :body: 'Unfortunately, dinner here was pretty disappointing. Maybe we ordered
      the &#34;wrong thing&#34; but for a restaurant that has 4.5 overall rating,
      I was surprised and left feeling underwhelmed.<br><br>SETTING: had a reservation
      for dinner on Friday night at 8pm. The restaurant is very very dark. It&#39;s
      a tight squeeze with tables quite close together. Good ambiance for a date.
      Completely full on a Friday night. <br><br>FOOD: we ordered 12 oysters (6 east
      coast, 6 west coast). These were probably the highlight of the meal And they
      weren&#39;t that great. We also ordered the uni (served with pieces of bread,
      salmon roe, raw egg) and the burrata (served with big pieces of pasta and some
      sweet tomato-y sauce). <br><br>The uni was just not that great a dish. And I
      LOVE uni. It was extremely fishy (understanding it&#39;s from Maine and won&#39;t
      be be as mild as uni from Japan) but it just didn&#39;t taste very fresh and
      didn&#39;t go as well as you would think with a raw egg broken on top and mixed
      with salmon roe and carrot purée. <br><br>The burrata was not very creamy or
      soft. It was also quite small and served with big pieces of pasta that did nothing
      with the burrata. We left the dish half eaten. <br><br>VERDICT: with all the
      amazing seafood restaurants in the city, I just don&#39;t think Upstate was
      up to par. My friend agreed that she would also give 3/5 stars for the food.
      Probably won&#39;t be back.'

      was a regular entree and he was also very satisfied with both the taste and
      the portion. As far as price goes, it&#39;s not too bad. For our meal, it was
      $34 (for once, we didn&#39;t order drinks).<br><br>At the end of the meal, they

      Tuesday at 830 pm. I made a same day reservation and was glad I did! The restaurant
      was 100% full (except for seats at the bar). <br><br>Our waiter greeted our
      table and quickly + we started with a bottle of Sav blanc that was perfectly
      tart and a dozen oysters. Huge selection of east coast oysters at 2.75/ea and

      the east coast oysters. The oysters were dope. I&#39;m not gonna pretend like
      I&#39;m an oyster expert but I asked for small and briney, I got small and briney,

      and turf (medium rare steak and grilled head on shrimp). Because we are both
      keto-ish, we asked for no potatoes and the server was happy to accommodate by
      adding more vegetables which was great. The surf and turf was flavored really
      well, but unfortunately the vegetables were cold. The steak of the day was prepared
      perfectly - super flakey but didn&#39;t have much flavor. The veggies with the
      fish were also cold and were supposed to be seasoned with a siracha butter but
      we couldn&#39;t find it. <br><br>The meal ended w complimentary whiskey cake

  - :body: After hearing tons of people rave about this spot, I&#39;ve finally decided
      to give it a try. I&#39;ve actually been back a second time so that definitely
      puts this restaurant on the &#34;bring people you&#39;d like to impress to&#34;
      list. I personally don&#39;t eat oysters (I know.... please don&#39;t stone
      me) but nonetheless it is a great freaking deal during happy hours. Additionally,
      I am someone who doesn&#39;t actually like seafood but the seafood here generally
      gets a thumbs up from me. Octopus is great because it is flavorful and soft.
      I&#39;d pass on the escargot though, it just wasn&#39;t that special. The risotto
      and fettuccine are amazing, scallops are not dry and flavorful, clams are creamy
      but also fresh. However, I&#39;d recommend eating these dishes as soon as possible
      because they wouldn&#39;t be as good if they&#39;re cold. <br><br>The only reason
      why there is a star off is because the space is teeny tiny and wait tune is
      always long. Since this is a busy spot, service will also be affected in terms
      of efficiency and quality. But if you don&#39;t mind these as much, please make
      a reservation and enjoy.

      table and quickly + we started with a bottle of Sav blanc that was perfectly
      tart and a dozen oysters. Huge selection of east coast oysters at 2.75/ea and
      a smaller selection of west coast at 3.75. You&#39;re on the east coast - get
      the east coast oysters. The oysters were dope. I&#39;m not gonna pretend like
      I&#39;m an oyster expert but I asked for small and briney, I got small and briney,
      and they were great.<br><br>For the main dishes we had the fish special + surf
      and turf (medium rare steak and grilled head on shrimp). Because we are both
      keto-ish, we asked for no potatoes and the server was happy to accommodate by
      adding more vegetables which was great. The surf and turf was flavored really
      well, but unfortunately the vegetables were cold. The steak of the day was prepared
      perfectly - super flakey but didn&#39;t have much flavor. The veggies with the
      fish were also cold and were supposed to be seasoned with a siracha butter but
      we couldn&#39;t find it. <br><br>The meal ended w complimentary whiskey cake
      which we took a bite of each (don&#39;t tell the keto police) and almost fell
      out with how moist and delicious it was...or maybe it&#39;s Bc of a month w
      no sugar.<br><br>4/5 stars - id go back for the oysters and wine, but may skip
      the entrees as they weren&#39;t seasoned particularly well.

    :body: After hearing tons of people rave about this spot, I&#39;ve finally decided
      to give it a try. I&#39;ve actually been back a second time so that definitely
      puts this restaurant on the &#34;bring people you&#39;d like to impress to&#34;
      list. I personally don&#39;t eat oysters (I know.... please don&#39;t stone
      me) but nonetheless it is a great freaking deal during happy hours. Additionally,
      I am someone who doesn&#39;t actually like seafood but the seafood here generally
      gets a thumbs up from me. Octopus is great because it is flavorful and soft.
      I&#39;d pass on the escargot though, it just wasn&#39;t that special. The risotto
      and fettuccine are amazing, scallops are not dry and flavorful, clams are creamy
      but also fresh. However, I&#39;d recommend eating these dishes as soon as possible
      because they wouldn&#39;t be as good if they&#39;re cold. <br><br>The only reason
      why there is a star off is because the space is teeny tiny and wait tune is
      always long. Since this is a busy spot, service will also be affected in terms
      of efficiency and quality. But if you don&#39;t mind these as much, please make
      a reservation and enjoy.

      caliber cheese from an assortment of animal milks. My partner loved the croquettes
      of the day and escargot. The frisee salad with poached eggs and asparagus were
      my delicious endeavor. The aioli looked homemade and rich in flavor .<br><br>Lastly
      but the most important in this review is the service, the team taking care of
      us were on top of things, pleasant, friendly and knowledgeable about their menu
      .They took marvelous care, booked our table for a few weeks out and made the
      dinner better through their care without ever interrupting. <br><br>I not only
      am a huge advocate of theirs but I will regularly return and absolutely use
      this as a quality restaurant to bring parents to when they visit .<br><br>Absolutely
      go - I think you&#39;ll be hard pressed not to fall as head over heels as we

      did not disappoint!<br>Every item we ordered was flavorful and delicious! For
      drinks me and my friend ordered the wine flight which was only ten dollars for
      three Georgian wines - a red, white, and amber, all were amazing.  <br><br>We
      ordered the adjaruli a traditional open faced  khachapuri with egg and cheese
      (think of an amazing cheesy bread bowl).  This is a must have! We also had a
      cold eggplant dish (Adjabsandali), their housemade dumplings with goat cheese
      and nuts  (Khinkali),  and the Chakapuli with lamb (a stew).  Words cannot express
      how delicious everything was you will need to experience this for yourself.<br><br>Service
      was amazing and attentive.  Even with a full dining room the waiter still came
      by refilled the water at the exact right time.  I am so happy we were able to
      get in here without a reservation.  Will for sure come back!

      by how spacious the inside is, and the fact that they take reservations is very
      convenient.<br><br>We ordered to share and tried a variety of the vegetarian
      options (which they had plenty of). My favorite was the Imeruli Cheese Bread.
      The Mushroom Chakapuli was good, but not particularly special and I would probably
      skip it in favor of more small plates<br><br>The main downside was the service.
      Our server brought us an incorrect dish. No problem, mistakes happen, but it
      took almost 20min for us to wave down a server to correct the issue. It took
      a similarly long time to correct our bill, which listed the same incorrect dish.
      All of the staff were very friendly and gave good recommendations. I think the
      issue is that they didn&#39;t have enough servers for the number of tables

  - :body: Went here for nyc restaurant week and while it might not have been the
      most worth it deal for that week, it was still a great promotion! <br><br>Our
      server was very attentive and energetic. The food portions were also pretty
      large so prepare your stomachs. Each of the burgers/rolls came with fries and
      a small salad. The fries honestly tasted so much like McDonald fries and the
      salad was mostly just arugula but the dressing was good. <br><br>The Original
      Burgers had a lot of oil/grease that would drip out of it when  you bit into
      it but according my family, it was still very tasty and good. The lobster in
      the original lobster roll was very good and flavorful but it was honestly the
      roll part that took the cake. I could honestly just eat the bread and be very
      content. Call me dumb for ordering a salad at a burger and lobster place but
      getting the lobster farro salad was the best decision. Super refreshing and
      everything complimented each other very well. Lobster was delicious.

      My words wouldn&#39;t do them justice so you&#39;d have to go and try them yourself.
      The burgers here are not just for one sitting they are humongous! The two ladies

      seated and I must say I was disappointed. We were seated right in front of the
      door . It&#39;s not fault of of the staff but personally think people don&#39;t
      like sitting in front of the door. Although this could be me. I can&#39;t take
      away from the establishment for seating us near the door . The real reason is
      the fact for a place that has the name burger they don&#39;t have have a great
      lettuce wrap for their burgers.  Personally I don&#39;t think anyone can eat
      complete lettuce head as a burger wrap. My husband couldn&#39;t eat it . The
      lobster was prepared scrumptiously. Then again I don&#39;t think you can screw
      that up!

      been to Luke&#39;s lobster, red hook lobster, and etc but so far Burger and
      Lobster beats them all.  Get the combo for 1.  Grilled lobster and medium well

    :body: This place is great. Located on the flatiron district my very first time
      stopping there. Very nice spacious atmosphere, it looks and feels upscale but
      not too uptight for casual attire. Tim was our server and he was on point. The
      food came out fast, hot, fresh, and correct. The lobster rolls were fabulous!
      My words wouldn&#39;t do them justice so you&#39;d have to go and try them yourself.
      The burgers here are not just for one sitting they are humongous! The two ladies
      had to split it on halves and both still had half of that to go lol. If I get
      a chance to go back here when we visit the city I WILL!

  - :body: The Halal Guys is iconic NYC. Everyone used to flock here after a night
      in the clubs back in the 00&#39;s.  The lines were long.  The customers drunk,
      boisterous and oftentimes looking to pick a fight.  And someone would always
      wait to buy food for everyone else.  10 combos, extra white sauce please.  <br><br>Nowadays,
      the lines are short and orderly.  Everyone knows they&#39;ll get their food.
       DH and I were walking to Hells Kitchen last week when we passed Halal Guys.
       We reminisced about all the times we ate their combo plate, we had even made
      it a moving day ritual at one time.  Of course, we stopped in our tracks, skipping
      out on our reservation and got on line.  We needed to see if the food was even
      close to our memories.  The line moved fast.  DH ordered a regular combo and
      I ordered a small falafel platter as I stopped eating meat 2 years ago. Both
      come with yellow rice, lettuce and pita.  The white sauce was just as good as
      I remember it.  You need it, the food is a bit dry without it and the hot sauce
      is as spicy as I remember it.  Use sparingly!!  You will ruin your food if you
      use too much, in addition to burn your mouth!  Use a little at a time, you can
      always add more!  My falafel was decent, not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but
      the white sauce and hot sauce made the dish.  The small was just the right portion
      size. <br><br>I don&#39;t usually eat street meat so don&#39;t have a point
      of comparison.  I can say you should eat at Halal Guys though because it&#39;s
      still the best street meat I&#39;ve ever eaten!

      visit every time I&#39;m in town. <br><br>The only downside is that it&#39;s
      hard to eat standing up. Not a complaint because that&#39;s what happens when
      you go to a food truck. So if comfort is really important then this might not
      be the right spot. <br><br>Overall really good, and I highly recommend it.

      heightened the flavors to a whole other level. Ugh. Wish we had this in Hawaii.

      the content from the containers. <br><br>I don&#39;t know if they normally would
      refresh it up when it&#39;s not raining, but maybe because they didn&#39;t,
      the meat felt a bit dry. Rice was good, i always enjoy Mediterranean rice. The
      vegetable portion was just iceberg lettuce. Where sauce was decent. Hot sauce
      was supppper hot like the dry hot type that just burns. The whole experience

      see people lined up from streets away below their yellow umbrellas... and the

      food within minutes. Right near the carts is a block of public benches, providing
      a good place to sit down with your food.<br><br>The regular sized platter itself
      is enough food for the entire day in one sitting, but they also offer a small

       DH and I were walking to Hells Kitchen last week when we passed Halal Guys.
       We reminisced about all the times we ate their combo plate, we had even made
      it a moving day ritual at one time.  Of course, we stopped in our tracks, skipping
      out on our reservation and got on line.  We needed to see if the food was even
      close to our memories.  The line moved fast.  DH ordered a regular combo and
      I ordered a small falafel platter as I stopped eating meat 2 years ago. Both
      come with yellow rice, lettuce and pita.  The white sauce was just as good as

    :comment: The hot sauce was on point! Be careful! It&#39;s spicy!!!!
    :body: My girlfriend from NYC directed us to eat here. Her specific instruction
      was to go to &#34;The Halal Guys&#34; cart. The name must have all three words,
      no less/no more, or else you&#39;re eating at a copy cat! THE. HALAL. GUYS.
      Remember that! And, it&#39;s the cart across the street from Hilton on W 53rd
      and 6th.<br><br>We found THE HALAL GUYS! Lol. Yep, there was a little wait on
      a Thursday at 1:30pm. But, not too long. A huge batch of meats were already
      prepared on the hot plate and ready to be scooped up and placed into a round
      foil platter or wrapped up into a sandwich.<br><br>Between the two of us, we
      decided to share a regular size Platter C, which was the Chicken and Beef Gyro
      combo. Lettuce, chicken, and beef over a bed of turmeric and cumin seasoned
      basmati rice with a few small slices of pita bread. Our plate was placed into
      a plastic bag with two packets of their famous white sauce and one packet of
      red sauce.<br><br>Now, my friend said the sauce packets are like gold. So, the
      smart thing to do is drizzle some sauce onto your food from the bottles at the
      cart and then you can save your packets for later! Unfortunately, no sauce bottles
      at the cart. Not sure if they discontinued this offering. Probably caught onto
      the sauce hype because I hear they actually charge for extra packets. The other
      tip, even if you love spicy, was to only squirt the red sauce into one corner
      instead of ALL OVER like the white sauce. Lol. I can see why. Trust me. It&#39;s
      hotttt!!!! And I love spicy!!!!<br><br>So since we were on vacay and didn&#39;t
      have an office to return to, we actually walked into the nearest Starbucks to
      purchase some cold beverages and then feast on our plates (we noticed others
      doing this, too!) in an air conditioned space.<br><br>The verdict?? OMG!! So
      DELICIOUS!! The chicken and beef were nicely seasoned and chopped in such a

      literally the best Hala food (and food in general) that we&#39;ve ever had.
      Their portions were perfect, the meat was well seasoned, the rice was unique,
      and their hot sauce packs a punch!  Everything went perfectly together. <br><br>Overall:
      One of the best food places in New York. Everybody needs to eat here at some
      point in their life. You get more than your money&#39;s worth here and won&#39;t
      be disappointed! We&#39;d recommend beating the lunch/dinner rushes and having

      like most NY restaurants, you cannot be seated until your entire party arrives,

      you have a big party, you will likely be seated at a big table with other parties,
      which makes it not ideal for date night but great other small parties to scope
      out what other items people are ordering. <br><br>I ended up getting the karaka-men,
      their tonkatsu ramen with a ball of spice on top, and I added the soft boiled
      egg as well. The broth had layers of flavors, and you can even see some of the
      discrete flavors in the photo before you mix them together. The noodles were
      a bit thin for my liking, but paired well with the rest of the dish. I personally
      prefer my ramen with an egg and it created an additional layer of flavor--both
      the egg and the way it was seasoned.

      630p on a Friday, and there was a table to be seated immediately. Unfortunately,
      like most NY restaurants, you cannot be seated until your entire party arrives,
      but even around 7, most parties were quoted only a half an hour wait. <br><br>Unless
      you have a big party, you will likely be seated at a big table with other parties,
      which makes it not ideal for date night but great other small parties to scope
      out what other items people are ordering. <br><br>I ended up getting the karaka-men,
      their tonkatsu ramen with a ball of spice on top, and I added the soft boiled
      egg as well. The broth had layers of flavors, and you can even see some of the
      discrete flavors in the photo before you mix them together. The noodles were
      a bit thin for my liking, but paired well with the rest of the dish. I personally
      prefer my ramen with an egg and it created an additional layer of flavor--both
      the egg and the way it was seasoned.

  - :body: Hooray For Dendur!<br><br>Today, I think I experienced a miracle. Let me
      tell you a little bit of backstory first, though. I have been running all over
      town buying C B D products for my wife, Wanda. She has been in what the doctors
      are calling a &#34;rapidly deteriorating condition&#34; for one wee3k now. I
      was trying to keep her awake by playing old episodes of American Gladiator,
      her favorite show, but she has been sleeping for the past two days now. Finally,
      I got her up and gave her another CBD infused olive shake, which got her a little
      nergized. I asked her &#34;Wanda is there anything you want to do now before
      it&#39;s too late?&#34; she told me &#34;yes&#34; and &#34;I want to go to the
      Met Museum to see the Dendur Temple. &#34; My eyes got wide as saucers. But
      of course I said &#34;yes.&#34; So I loaded her up in the car and got her caretaker&#39;s
      approval and we zoomed off to Cendtral PArk. <br>Okay, back to the main point.
      But first, one small complaint. The staff at the museum told my wife she wasn&#39;t
      following the dress code because she was wearing her hospice gown. They said
      she would have to cover up if she wanted to come in the museum. But I gave them
      a piece of my mind! But then I had to go to the bathroom. When I got back there
      was a whole crowd of young people taking pictures of her on their Smart Phones.
      They all asked me some questions about the Camp exhibit and I told them this
      isn&#39;t Camp, kids, its the Metropolitan Museum of Art! Kids these days are
      really idiots. Anyway, the guard figured out that Wanda was coming into the
      museum one way or the other so they let us through.<br>We got to the Dendur
      Temple and I rolled my Wanda right on past the line and straight into that temple
      gate. Then all the sudden she starts moaning. The guards asked me sir is your
      wife alright? And she was thrashing and said &#34;O Horus!!&#34; I said &#34;Wanda
      did I give you too much CBD?&#34; Then she sat straight up and looked in my
      eyes and said , &#34; My Husband, I am healed!&#34; Needless to say, I will
      be coming back to the Metropolitan Museum and to the Dendur Temple many many
      more times!! Would recommend to anyone who needs  a little &#39;Pick me Up!&#34;

  - :body: A review long overdue, considering I&#39;ve been here upwards of ten times
      over the quarter century I&#39;ve been living in New York! They restructured
      the whole place a few years ago, so the layout makes a lot more sense and is
      a lot easier to navigate. My favorite permanent section is the European painting
      section on the second floor, which houses many excellent and well-labeled pieces
      by Monet, Van Gogh, and Pissarro. The Egyptian section is also excellent and
      is as good as the Egyptian Museum in Egypt. They also have a yearly fashion
      exhibit (China Through the Looking Glass a few years ago, Camp this year) that
      is well curated and well attended. Since it&#39;s one of the world&#39;s best
      museums, it can get pretty crowded, especially on weekends. You can spend the
      whole day here and still not finish seeing everything.

      was very informative and he knew the park like the back of his hand. We were

      a great respite from the craziness in the streets. The park is huge for being

      to do. <br><br>We walked to the park a couple weeks ago after an early dinner
      and while we weren&#39;t there very long it was nice to get a short walk in
      after a big meal. My only negative while in the park was the smell of pot everywhere.
      I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not like that throughout the whole park, but where we
      were it was really annoying.

    :comment: Central Park
    :body: When I went to New York this was definitely on my l&#34; to go list&#34;.
      My friend and I were planning on riding the horse and carriage ride but ended
      up getting harrassed by quite a few bicycle hustlers ( bicycle tour guides).
      We weren&#39;t sure what to make of them at first but we knew how to haggle
      back with prices, so we decided to go with  one of the bicycle tour guides instead
      of the carriage ride. <br><br>We met up with one of my friends who lives in
      New York and has never done the bicycle ride so this was already going to be
      interesting. I have to say this was a fun tour because our guide was so hilarious
      as he had us laughing and giggling so much. He was definitely a character. He
      was very informative and he knew the park like the back of his hand. We were
      very happy with our tour! We definitely saved money by doing the bicycle tour
      instead of the carriage ride. So that is something to think about if you decide
      to visit Central Park for the first time. <br><br>This is such a beautiful park
      with a rich history surrounding it. The scenery is breathtaking.  I fell in
      love with this park. I would totally go back here again.

      cool seeing the architecture and being able to just take some time to people
      watch. There are quite a few benches but also a couple parts were blocked off.
      It&#39;ll be even greater when those are open! It was pretty crowded during
      the summer, an hour or two before sunset. <br><br>I will say, if it&#39;s your

      District areas. I thoroughly enjoyed an early morning walk on the High Line,
      which was built on a historic, elevated freight line formerly known as the New
      York Central Railroad spur. No admission fee! It&#39;s free to explore!!<br><br>If
      my photos link up to this review, you can see portions of the original rail
      in the red door photo as well as under the wooden lounge chair. The last photo
      is what the High Line looks like from the street level. So glad the abondoned
      rail was repurposed!<br><br>From a little past The Vessel (TKA) landmark, the
      walk was about 1.25 miles to the opposite end of the line. Along the path are
      lovely garden areas, art pieces, the mini AMOR and LOVE sculptures, sundeck
      &amp; water feature, 10th Ave Square, which is the the large sitting area overlooking
      the street traffic, the High Line Shop for souvenirs, and a few food and beverage
      vendors.<br><br>At one point on the High Line, you can take the stairs down
      to Chelsea Market. So much fun in this city!!

      you can leisurely stroll on the Lower East side. There are shops below at various

    :body: The High Line is really just one of the places to come hang out with family
      and friends or take a nice stroll with your loved one holding hands and just
      enjoying the views . <br><br>I&#39;ve come here multiple times and can really
      appreciate how much effort that has been put into keeping this park clean and
      beautiful. The High Line can be described as a long stretch of walkway tucked
      in back of the Meat Packing district. It is a few short feet away from great
      restaurants such as &#34;Catch&#34;, &#34;Serafina&#34; , and &#34;Stk&#34;.

      rail was repurposed!<br><br>From a little past The Vessel (TKA) landmark, the
      walk was about 1.25 miles to the opposite end of the line. Along the path are
      lovely garden areas, art pieces, the mini AMOR and LOVE sculptures, sundeck
      &amp; water feature, 10th Ave Square, which is the the large sitting area overlooking
      the street traffic, the High Line Shop for souvenirs, and a few food and beverage

  - :body: The Art of Simplicity <br><br>Its truly was the art of simplicity, the
      items on the menu are nothing crazy, good hardy normal foods, but the preparations
      are perfect bringing the ordinary into the extraordinary. <br><br>The place
      itself has an elevated beer hall vibe to it reminding me of my time spent in
      Germany. The service was quick and efficient, some of the members were very
      warm while others seemed a bit cold. Our server was great!<br><br>We ordered
      the steak for two which is a dry aged porterhouse, medium rare of course. When
      the steak came it was sizzling hot and smelled like heaven. The waiters prepare
      your plates which I always like, not enough restaurants do this. The steak was
      simply perfect, the outside had a nice thick char that held the juices in. The
      interior was soft like butter. Having eaten at many fine steak house I was surprised
      at how this felt unlike any of the others, the steak was just different, better.
      <br><br>On the side we ordered the Special German Fried Potatoes and the Creamed
      Spinach. The potatoes were delicious, lots of crunchy bits and cut into small
      pieces. Great addition to the steak, a good mix of earthy flavors. The creamed
      spinach was good, not really my cup of tea but my wife said it was delicious.
      <br><br>For desert we had the Apple Strudel with generous amounts of Schlag
      dumped on top of it! The strudel was very good, the dough was flaky and light
      with a subtle sweetness to it. The apples were soft and well spiced. The schlag
      was delicious, heavy with some extra sweetness and a kiss of vanilla. <br><br>We
      left there stuffed!

      and waiting until we felt comfortable spending the money. We got there excited
      and ready to enjoy our meal; immediately, the host was terse and annoyed as
      he snapped at us for the details of our reservation. We were taken to a table
      upstairs where another, equally grumpy member of staff dropped menus on our
      table. Couple of minutes later, we ordered a slice of bacon, the steak for two
      at around $110, and German fried potatoes. The bacon arrived immediately and
      was pretty good but not stunning. The bread was alright. The steak arrived soon
      after. It was a huge cut of meat that would fill you up without sides. It was
      cooked nicely and seemed underseasoned, though it was nonetheless delicious.
      Why only two stars? Well, it felt like we were on a conveyor belt. We were out
      in less than thirty five minutes and didn&#39;t even rush. Everything is significantly
      more expensive than it&#39;s worth; the whole place is obviously coasting on
      its reputation. It makes sense as a place for tourists to go to so they can
      eat a Big Slab of American Meat, but don&#39;t go there for a nice experience.
      You are paying for a big slab of meat.<br><br>Also- as we walked out, a door
      to the back areas of the restaurant was pinned wide open; on it was a big sign
      stating &#39;ATTENTION: THIS DOOR MUST REMAIN CLOSED AT ALL TIMES.&#39; Kinda
      summed things up- a big gap between how things should be and how they actually
      are.'

  - :body: Heard great things about Peter Luger, we made dinner reservations almost
      a month in advance. We came for a pretty early dinner 4:45 and the restaurant
      was packed!! We ate a late lunch so we ended up sharing the bone in ribeye instead
      of the steak for 2. The ribeye was delicious and cooked perfectly. People were
      raving about the bacon but I thought it just tasted like any other bacon but
      a thicker cut. I didn&#39;t understand the hype over that. We ordered the creamed
      spinach and German potato&#39;s and the bf and I both agreed that it was whatever&#39;s.
      We probably could&#39;ve skipped the sides or go with the baked potato instead,
      cause you can&#39;t mess that up. Anyways, the steak was a huge portion and
      we were not able to finish it so we took it to go. We ordered cheesecake for
      dessert and it comes with a giant thing of whipped cream! I loved the cheesecake
      because the crust was on the thicker side, it was sooo good!! <br><br>Overall
      I think the steak is delicious! I would probably return for that. Also the restaurant
      is cash only!

      Luger is one of the most tastiest steaks I have had and I&#39;m glad I got to
      try it out in their Brooklyn location while I was on vacation. <br><br>Please
      make reservations because this place was insanity when you walk into this place.
      It was filled with tons of people waiting for their name to be called. Don&#39;t
      worry the bar is towards the left side, so you could grab a drink and wait a
      little for your table. <br><br>Once your name is called you&#39;ll get seated
      to your table. It looks super old school and pretty vintage. Overall you feel
      like your inside a home a very large home with tons of guest. <br><br>The steaks
      were shareable between a group of us. Our party had 5 people and we ordered
      two different types of steaks. The steaks were different cuts and super tasty.
      Got them medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. <br><br>Glad we came and
      tried this old school spot out. It blew my mind how the steak is.

      been very memorable and tasty with the exception of the latest meal I had. We
      were a party of 9 and made the reservation three weeks ahead of the time by
      calling. <br><br>I arrived early for my 2.45pm reservation and sat by the bar.
      Our group ordered a variety of beverages including juices for kids. There was
      grapefruit juice being offered which I do not recommend - it was literally poured
      out of a Snapple bottle. My friend ordered a martini which unfortunately got
      knocked over by another friend. I was hoping at this point that the barman would
      offer a replacement drink, but he did not. I absolutely understand that they
      are not obliged to but it would have been a nice touch given the drink was still
      full and we had given him a tip prior to the spillage. Nevertheless our group
      carried on and had another round of drinks at the bar before we were called
      to our tables upstairs.<br><br>My group ended up ordering the following at the
      table: <br><br>- 4 servings of thick cut bacon<br>- Porterhouse for 5, one serving
      rare and the other medium rare<br>- Onion rings<br>- Fries<br>- German potatoes<br>-
      Creamed spinach<br>- 3 sundaes<br>- a pecan tart<br>- A bottle of Peter Lugers
      house red<br>- A bottle of Mumm Napa champagne<br>- A cocktail <br><br>The thick
      cut bacon came fresh from the kitchen and the group devoured the bacon like
      there is no tomorrow. It is so good, almost like butter melting in your mouth.<br><br>The
      steak, whilst it was still good, was not as consistent as prior visits. The
      rare was cooked perfectly and thoroughly enjoyable, however the medium rare
      porterhouse was overcooked with each sides of the meat visibly of different
      colors. I did let the waiter know of our disappointment and his response was
      out of the thousands of steaks the chef may have cooked for the day, he may
      have had an &#34;off&#34; one. The waiter did not really acknowledge our concern
      / disappointment and rather shrugged it off. Considering that we are paying
      big bucks for these steaks, I would have thought he would have addressed our
      concern with perhaps a follow up conversation with the manager.<br><br>Nevertheless
      we carried on with our meals, moving on to desserts. It was my friend&#39;s
      birthday and they kindly came around and sang her a happy birthday song and
      also placed a candle on top one of the sundaes we ordered. The desserts were
      pretty good, especially the extra bowl of cream they provided. I thought that
      was a nice as I have never experienced this before.<br><br>In total the check
      came to just over $600 excluding tax and tip. We did have a good, enjoyable
      meal in a group setting. Will I come back here again, trekking from Manhattan
      to Brooklyn? After this experience, probably not. Personally I think the steak
      is probably close enough to what I can get from Wolfgangs which is much easier
      for me to get to.'

      to try it.  Decided to grab a reservation for a birthday celebration.  <br><br>Staff:
      Setup is confusing when you walk in. Although there is a clear location for
      payment and what looks to be the host area, no one greets you when you walk
      in or when you walk up to the &#39;host area&#39;.  For a high end restaurant,
      you definitely don&#39;t get the service of one.  You get better treatment at
      a Red Lobster when you walk in. <br><br>Also, I&#39;d expect that each party
      is seated individually at such an establishment; wrong.  They pretty much call
      your name in groups and &#39;lead&#39; everyone to their tables. No greeting.
      No welcome to our restaurant. Not even an acknowledgement of your existence
      other than to see someone responded to the last name they called. If you&#39;re
      a step too slow you might actually lose the host and which direction he went.
       <br><br>Maybe it&#39;s me and I&#39;m not used to the East Coast style of customer
      service? But I feel like when you ask if this is where you need to check in
      for your reservation they should say something to the effect of, &#39;We will
      be with you in just a second&#39; instead of &#39;hold on a sec&#39;.  <br><br>Food:
      I was completely disappointed by the steak. Especially with such raving reviews.
      I almost believe it&#39;s just hype for an expensive tourist trap that&#39;s
      not even in a touristy area!  <br><br>The positive: perfectly charred steak.
       Cream of spinach was mostly spinach and tasted delicious.  <br><br>The negative:
      we asked for a &#39;medium&#39; and the steak ranged from blue to medium.  I&#39;m
      sorry but for $109 for a steak for two, you better cook that steak perfectly
      and it better be on point.  Nope.  I think the steaks are dry-aged? I couldn&#39;t
      tell because it did nothing for the flavor.  I&#39;ve had my fair share of dry-aged
      steaks and this was nothing compared to other high-end steak restaurants.  <br><br>The
      steak sauce was house made. It was okay. Hubs wasn&#39;t a fan as it was on
      the sweeter side for a steak sauce.  It was okay to me but that&#39;s mostly
      because I was looking for anything to give the steak flavor so I used the steak
      sauce and salt and pepper.  <br><br>I&#39;ve had many perfectly made steaks
      at many other lesser known steakhouses and restaurants that were dry-aged to
      perfection and were extremely flavorful on their own. <br><br>Overall, I was

      all the hoopla surrounding Peter Luger, it was without question that I had to
      pay a visit and digest some of their world-renowned steaks. I had made a reservation
      through their website a month in advance for dinner on a Thursday at 7:45 p.m.
      to celebrate my beloved sister&#39;s birthday. The online reservation system
      was very user-friendly and convenient. <br><br>We arrived 15 minutes early and
      were told to wait a few minutes for our table. We didn&#39;t have to wait long
      and were seated next to one of the large windows overlooking Broadway Street.
      Our waiter was jovial, knowledgeable and efficient. He had a dry sense of humor
      which we found amusing. <br><br>We started off with the Caesar salad which managed
      to be amazing with crunchy, fresh lettuce and grated Pecorino Romano. We ordered
      the Steak for Two (which is the Porterhouse steak) and the Rib Steak which has
      more marbling and fat. We also chose two sides, the creamed spinach and the
      Luger&#39;s Special German fried potatoes. Both sides are good for 2 people.
      <br><br>When the food arrived, we took one look at our overladen table and predicted
      that leftovers would definitely result due to our ambitious ordering strategy.
      But against all odds and to everyone&#39;s amazement, no steak, potato or spinach
      was left standing. We looked with pride and a sense of accomplishment at the
      bare bones left on our otherwise empty plates. My sister and I both concluded
      that we had just experienced meat nirvana. My sister preferred the Porterhouse
      and I liked the Rib-eye more. Our waiter also recommended eating the steaks
      sans any gravy or sauce in order to fully enjoy the seasoning and core flavors
      of the meats.<br><br>Payment choices include cash, personal check with ID and
      debit card. We also got a pile of milk chocolate Peter Luger coins at the end
      of our incredible meal. We were too stuffed to order any desserts.<br><br>They
      have a tiny nook of a gift shop in the restaurant which sells Peter Luger merchandise
      including the Luger sauce, but one can only buy meats online. They ship all
      over the United States and they accept credit cards for online purchases.<br><br>I

      beer-hallesque ambience abound.

      expect to chill a bit at the front/bar while they wait and prep your table.<br><br>Between
      the 6 of us, we ordered the thick-cut bacon, Caesar Salad for starters, Steak
      for Four, Rib Steak for mains, and the potatoes and creamed Spinach for sides.
      Also on the table is a gravy boat of their house sauce, which to me tasted similar
      to a cocktail sauce, definitely has some horseradish.<br><br>Going straight
      to the steaks, ordering-wise there really wasn&#39;t much options so don&#39;t
      worry about not being able to decide what to get. The huge steaks come out on
      a hot plate, cut up already. The waiter will serve you a couple slices, and
      drizzle over some oil/butter from the plate. Good crust, strong beef taste.
      The tenderloin part of the porterhouse is very tender. A good amount of fat,
      and just a hint of aged flavour.<br><br>Service is not necessarily the best,

    :body: I&#39;m shocked I never wrote a review for the Brooklyn location ... since
      I&#39;ve been coming here for years (decades).<br><br>Plenty of reviews for
      this joint so in short:<br><br>- This place is pretty identical to the Great
      Neck location in terms of food.  You won&#39;t lose out going to either place.<br>-
      The decor is still the same old beer-hall style ambiance<br>- The service is
      what it is.  You have a mix of exuberant or grouchy waiters.  Coin flip on who
      you&#39;ll end up with<br>- The steak is great but to be honest maybe it&#39;s
      because the competition is improving but for me this just doesn&#39;t have the
      same allure as before.  It&#39;s not that the steak is bad (it&#39;s still great)
      but there are other great places in the city as well that have closed the gap<br>-
      I still think Wolfgang&#39;s has better side dishes than PL, most notably the
      creamed spinach<br>- The bacon is still good but other places make it just as
      good now<br>- As you&#39;d expect it gets packed in here<br>- Parking is convenient
      and just down the street<br>- Price is expensive but not demented<br>- I still
      love their killer sundae, but it&#39;s rare to have the stomach for it after
      such a huge meal<br><br>Is it worth a repeat visit?<br>- Yes if you are a PL
      loyalist<br>- Yes if you&#39;re a tourist who&#39;s in the mood for their signature
      porterhouse<br>- No if you live in Manhattan and it&#39;s a schlep for you (there
      are other great options in the city that have truly upped their game .. or are
      at least close enough to merit not hauling your ass to Brooklyn or Long Island)

    :body: Heard great things about Peter Luger, we made dinner reservations almost
      a month in advance. We came for a pretty early dinner 4:45 and the restaurant
      was packed!! We ate a late lunch so we ended up sharing the bone in ribeye instead
      of the steak for 2. The ribeye was delicious and cooked perfectly. People were
      raving about the bacon but I thought it just tasted like any other bacon but
      a thicker cut. I didn&#39;t understand the hype over that. We ordered the creamed
      spinach and German potato&#39;s and the bf and I both agreed that it was whatever&#39;s.
      We probably could&#39;ve skipped the sides or go with the baked potato instead,
      cause you can&#39;t mess that up. Anyways, the steak was a huge portion and
      we were not able to finish it so we took it to go. We ordered cheesecake for
      dessert and it comes with a giant thing of whipped cream! I loved the cheesecake
      because the crust was on the thicker side, it was sooo good!! <br><br>Overall
      I think the steak is delicious! I would probably return for that. Also the restaurant
      is cash only!

      It was filled with tons of people waiting for their name to be called. Don&#39;t
      worry the bar is towards the left side, so you could grab a drink and wait a
      little for your table. <br><br>Once your name is called you&#39;ll get seated
      to your table. It looks super old school and pretty vintage. Overall you feel
      like your inside a home a very large home with tons of guest. <br><br>The steaks
      were shareable between a group of us. Our party had 5 people and we ordered
      two different types of steaks. The steaks were different cuts and super tasty.
      Got them medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. <br><br>Glad we came and
      tried this old school spot out. It blew my mind how the steak is.

    :body: Great place and definitely worth trying and not crazy expensive for great
      quality steak. Everything comes out very fresh, like hot off the pan. We got
      a slice of bacon, steak for two, potatoes for one, fresh broccoli, and two glasses
      of wine (large pourings) for around $210. I would recommend everything, especially
      the broccoli surprisingly, which had more flavor for being steamed. Also bread
      was so good? Just wish they had it warmed up or something

    :comment: Left - Steak for two; Right - Rib Steak
    :body: This is the place where beef becomes steak and steak becomes manna. After
      all the hoopla surrounding Peter Luger, it was without question that I had to
      pay a visit and digest some of their world-renowned steaks. I had made a reservation
      through their website a month in advance for dinner on a Thursday at 7:45 p.m.
      to celebrate my beloved sister&#39;s birthday. The online reservation system
      was very user-friendly and convenient. <br><br>We arrived 15 minutes early and
      were told to wait a few minutes for our table. We didn&#39;t have to wait long
      and were seated next to one of the large windows overlooking Broadway Street.
      Our waiter was jovial, knowledgeable and efficient. He had a dry sense of humor
      which we found amusing. <br><br>We started off with the Caesar salad which managed
      to be amazing with crunchy, fresh lettuce and grated Pecorino Romano. We ordered
      the Steak for Two (which is the Porterhouse steak) and the Rib Steak which has
      more marbling and fat. We also chose two sides, the creamed spinach and the
      Luger&#39;s Special German fried potatoes. Both sides are good for 2 people.
      <br><br>When the food arrived, we took one look at our overladen table and predicted
      that leftovers would definitely result due to our ambitious ordering strategy.
      But against all odds and to everyone&#39;s amazement, no steak, potato or spinach
      was left standing. We looked with pride and a sense of accomplishment at the
      bare bones left on our otherwise empty plates. My sister and I both concluded
      that we had just experienced meat nirvana. My sister preferred the Porterhouse
      and I liked the Rib-eye more. Our waiter also recommended eating the steaks
      sans any gravy or sauce in order to fully enjoy the seasoning and core flavors
      of the meats.<br><br>Payment choices include cash, personal check with ID and
      debit card. We also got a pile of milk chocolate Peter Luger coins at the end
      of our incredible meal. We were too stuffed to order any desserts.<br><br>They
      have a tiny nook of a gift shop in the restaurant which sells Peter Luger merchandise
      including the Luger sauce, but one can only buy meats online. They ship all
      over the United States and they accept credit cards for online purchases.<br><br>I
      encourage people to enter the world of Peter Luger where great food and German
      beer-hallesque ambience abound.

    :body: Im still having trouble finding the words to express how happy and how
      glad I am after my second Peter Luger experience of the year.<br><br>I get reservation
      for 4 to celebrate my fathers birthday, and enjoying our meeting after 2 years.
      I asked if we could have a nice table by the window in one of the salons downstairs
      giving the reason why we would have that special meal, and the nailed it. <br><br>We
      enjoyed an amazing meal with the best service. We started with some of their
      delicious breads and butter (it&#39;s hard to stop eating! They are completely
      addictive!) with the tender and juicy bacon and their signature sauce. And following
      that such an amazing bite, we had the steak for 3 and a green salad.<br><br>What
      can I say besides the meat was absorbed perfect, I enjoyed so much better the
      second time. It&#39;s so delicious that even if you&#39;re not a meat fan you
      will enjoy it. You can taste the level of quality in the meat, that comes without
      any salt. You can add it or having it with their sauce, I enjoyed it just with
      a tiny bit of salt to embrace the flavors.<br><br>We didn&#39;t finish hungry
      at all, but we needed to have the cheesecake at least, and I ordered also the
      pecan pie a la mode because either my parents or my sister ever had one before.
      <br><br>So the service arrived, singing louder happy birthday, bringing the
      pie with the candle, and giving him a huge surprise (because we are not used
      to do the same in Spain).<br><br>We had a memorable meal, not just because of
      the delicious food, the place is just magical.

    :body: Im still having trouble finding the words to express how happy and how
      glad I am after my second Peter Luger experience of the year.<br><br>I get reservation
      for 4 to celebrate my fathers birthday, and enjoying our meeting after 2 years.
      I asked if we could have a nice table by the window in one of the salons downstairs
      giving the reason why we would have that special meal, and the nailed it. <br><br>We
      enjoyed an amazing meal with the best service. We started with some of their
      delicious breads and butter (it&#39;s hard to stop eating! They are completely
      addictive!) with the tender and juicy bacon and their signature sauce. And following
      that such an amazing bite, we had the steak for 3 and a green salad.<br><br>What
      can I say besides the meat was absorbed perfect, I enjoyed so much better the
      second time. It&#39;s so delicious that even if you&#39;re not a meat fan you
      will enjoy it. You can taste the level of quality in the meat, that comes without
      any salt. You can add it or having it with their sauce, I enjoyed it just with
      a tiny bit of salt to embrace the flavors.<br><br>We didn&#39;t finish hungry
      at all, but we needed to have the cheesecake at least, and I ordered also the
      pecan pie a la mode because either my parents or my sister ever had one before.
      <br><br>So the service arrived, singing louder happy birthday, bringing the
      pie with the candle, and giving him a huge surprise (because we are not used
      to do the same in Spain).<br><br>We had a memorable meal, not just because of
      the delicious food, the place is just magical.

    :body: Came here with my family and I must say this restaurant did meet my expectations.
      With all the hype around their steak, I&#39;ve been wanting to try Peter Luger
      and I was pleased with the food, service, and price. <br><br>My parents and
      I got their iceberg Wedge salad, Steak for two, Creamed spinach, and for dessert,
      we got their Key lime pie with their homemade whipped cream. <br><br>The salad
      was decent and I especially like the bacon bits. I know they are also known
      for their bacon and we were going to get that as an appetizer, but I&#39;m glad
      I got to try some of it from the salad. <br><br>The steak was awesome -- the
      meat was so juicy, extremely tender, and it literally melted in my mouth. They
      gave us their special steak sauce, but I mostly just ate the steak by itself
      with some salt because the meat itself was delicious. It went well with the
      creamed spinach and I loved it, but my parents thought it was a bit bland. <br><br>I&#39;m
      also glad I got their key lime pie for dessert even though I was so full. The
      pie was refreshing and tasty, and the whipped cream went well with it even though
      I usually don&#39;t like whipped cream. <br><br>Overall, it was definitely one
      of the best steaks I&#39;ve ever had and I think it does live up to its reputation.

      my 7th avenue apartment and set out on foot to come check it all out! It was
      finnaly here! Thevbuilding was packed with tourist and speculators from all
      over the world!Inside was a beautifully crafted staircase. <br>There were so
      many shops and resturants! I couldn&#39;t help but to wonder and explore. Everything
      was so new and shiny! I found a snack inside of the market place and ate sat
      down. This is very important beacuse a lot of people had told me that there
      was no place to sit and eat here. I walked through Louis viutton, Fendi, and
      Guggi. I checked out every store. We ended up leaving exhausted from all of

      to the right place. <br><br>This big, beautiful new mall is many thousands of
      square feet of marble-floored luxury stores, including bathrooms where sinks
      have automatic band dryers built in (next to the automatic water and soap dispensers).
      People here are so rich they don&#39;t have to turn around. Because turning
      around is for poor people.<br><br>I think Banana Republic is the most affordable
      clothing you can buy in here...everything else is single-name fancy designers
      that sell clothes I don&#39;t really like (that&#39;s a me problem though).<br><br>Hungry?
      There&#39;s Shake Shack and Fuku Dylan&#39;s Candy and way more, including a
      $140 steak at a restaurant that isn&#39;t even the priciest in the whole joint.
      <br><br>But it&#39;s nice. It&#39;s clean. It&#39;s exactly what you want if
      you&#39;re a high-end shopper.<br><br>And my favorite part is that they&#39;ve
      installed a relaxation room called 3DEN where there are phone chargers, comfortable
      places to sit, showers, nap pods, clean private bathrooms, and free coffee.
      <br><br>Sure, it costs $6 per half hour to hang out in there, and I&#39;ll never
      do that, but it&#39;s actually a very savvy business model for all the people
      that spend the day walking the High Line/the rest of NYC, and need to rest their
      feet a bit. It&#39;s also not a terrible deal considering coffee everywhere
      else is pretty expensive. <br><br>There&#39;s even a tree swing that I saw from

      Yards want you to know one thing, for sure, that they are not a mall. They will

      While there&#39;s no food court native to any mall, most of the restaurants
      are scattered about with a few clustered here and there. Stores are very open
      and easy to get lost in. And that appears to be the running theme of the place:
      easy to get lost in so you spend more time in it, and in theory, spend more
      money. The signage is poor, there aren&#39;t enough places to sit/eat if you&#39;re
      taking out food from a fast-casual spot, and, at least the 4th floor bathroom,
      is really small! Like, don&#39;t even try to bring your shopping bags, baby

      are now state of the art with blow dryers for your hands right at the sink basin.

      Tiffany to their flagship Neiman Marcus. I thought if time permitted it would

      this place exists now!<br><br>At first when I walked in, I thought... Ugh another
      high end mall with unaffordable junk. But then when I walked around a bit I
      found H&amp;M, Uniqlo, muji, and other regular stores!<br><br>There are bathrooms
      on floors 2-4, floor 2 is obviously always packed so just skip it and go higher
      up. There is an entrance to the mall right off the Highline and another one
      near the Vessel.<br><br>I also did a free yoga class at the park across the
      street. There are other free workouts and events, just search for HYHK. I recommend
      this place to anyone in the area, I wouldn&#39;t make a special trip or anything.

      were working... and the air conditioning was weak! I literally felt like I was

    :body: I remember watching in anticipation as this place was being built. A brand
      new shopping center in nyc with impeccable architecture and a sexy layout that
      overlooks the Hudson. I would look up during my daily run and wonder what the
      inside of this place would look like.. When it opened, I was so excited! I left
      my 7th avenue apartment and set out on foot to come check it all out! It was
      finnaly here! Thevbuilding was packed with tourist and speculators from all
      over the world!Inside was a beautifully crafted staircase. <br>There were so
      many shops and resturants! I couldn&#39;t help but to wonder and explore. Everything
      was so new and shiny! I found a snack inside of the market place and ate sat
      down. This is very important beacuse a lot of people had told me that there
      was no place to sit and eat here. I walked through Louis viutton, Fendi, and
      Guggi. I checked out every store. We ended up leaving exhausted from all of
      the site seeing and decided it was time to go. I&#39;ll defiantly be back when
      I go to the city for my quarterly visit. This place revives me!

      time and I also found a really good fit for a tank top. But yes you could be
      in this place for hours if you enjoy shopping or maybe eating. But if you like
      both you might end up spending a whole lotta time inside. <br><br>Plenty of
      people were here but still didn&#39;t seem to overcrowded except for the bathrooms
      that was a little bit of a long line for the women&#39;s side. <br><br>Tip-

      turned me off to them (long lines that stretch out the doors to get in, long
      lines once you&#39;re in to order a drink at the bar, spending $$$ to crowd
      around). <br><br>Rooftop 93 is on the 16th flr of the Bowery Hotel and has a
      beautiful view of the city inside, and then only gets better once you walk another
      flight up to the outdoor roof area. There&#39;s a small bar there with very
      friendly bartenders who are quick and efficient. There&#39;s a great happy hour
      deal with beer and well drinks. For people who avoid hard liquor, this place
      also has these delicious champagne drinks served in a big glass with a spiked
      champagne popsicle. <br><br>This is a great place to go with a big group of

      Yes, the space is a lot smaller than Mr. Purple or the other over-glorified
      spots, but it does the trick and the views are still gorgeous.<br><br>Drinks
      were kinda pricey for the size - $12 for a small Rum Punch - but, when in Rome...<br><br>There&#39;s

      rooftop bar. I found myself laughing with a stranger on the ride up making conversation.
      Jeff later turned out to be the owner. He made a point to come over to our table
      and exchange pleasantries. He&#39;s genuinely a super cool guy, and sent a round
      of shots to my table for my date and I. Couldn&#39;t be happier to know a hip
      spot is run by a standup gentleman. <br><br>I ended up here on a Monday night
      for the happy hour special which was such a good deal. 4 shots in a tall mixed
      drink which was delicious. Even more, I chose this location because I wanted
      to look over the city amidst the shitty weather. I got to witness lightning

  - :body: If your looking for a chill spot on a Friday night check this place out.
      It&#39;s located in the Hilton hotel. The rooftop has two sections. There in
      an outside part and an indoor part. Both have bars. The music was really good
      and everyone there was very nice. The drinks are pricey but it&#39;s Nyc so
      that&#39;s typical. They def don&#39;t skim on the liquor the drinks are strong
      and good. It closes at 2 the Friday I went there. I wish I hadda got their earlier.
      It&#39;s not a lot of places in that area where I can listen to r&amp;b and
      hop in a chill environment. I enjoyed that there was a good amount of seating.
      This will be my go to if I&#39;m in that area hanging out late night!

      the fact that this rooftop is not like the crowded midtown rooftops. We got
      there in time for the happy hour which was buy one get one 50% off. The drink
      prices were about $12 each which is very reasonable. <br><br>The blue lagoon
      drink was very sweet, but the rum punch was more tame and delicious. <br><br>This

      You can justify it any way you want, relieve stress, mentally shoot that ex

      some rounds and wanted a buddy.<br><br>The location is a bit difficult to find.
      It&#39;s right next to a strip club so be careful! You walk past security and
      down the stairs, then boom you&#39;re there. <br><br>They check you in and then
      you get a brief crash course on how to fire in a safe and effective way. My
      dumbass, was lost and the instructor picked up on it immediately. However he
      was very patient with me and helped me along the way.<br><br>Onto the shooting
      range. Omfg. THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME AND BOY IS IT AN EXPERIENCE. The woman next
      to us was using a handgun and practicing. THAT SHIT IS SO FUCKING LOUD THAT
      I FLINCHED. It&#39;s not easy. At all. There&#39;s a process to it. Load the
      bullets, make sure that the safety is on (I cannot emphasize this enough) and
      then make sure your position is right. For me personally, that was the hardest
      part to grasp. You have to position your eyes at eye level, guide the gun to
      aim at your target, lean your body forward, left hand underneath holding the
      gun properly, shut your left eye (if you&#39;re right handed). Idk about you,
      but as a first time shooter, that&#39;s a lot of information to grasp and retain.
      As you will see, I fucking sucked. First instructor had it with my incompetence
      and nearly gave up on me.<br><br>BUT THEN SOMETHING AMAZING HAPPENED. Then comes
      in a second instructor and he says &#34;can I yell at you?&#34; Sure. I&#39;m
      sucking and could use all the help I can get. He provided effective criticism
      on how to shoot. Still I sucked. THEN THE MAGIC HAPPENED. He said switch it
      to your left hand. It MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. I won&#39;t say
      I was perfect but there was significant improvements than when using my right
      hand. Mind you, I&#39;m right handed yet shot better using my left. <br><br>We
      went through the 50 bullets pretty quickly. But I can certainly see the appeal
      for it. You want to see yourself improve. There&#39;s easily a rush to it. Mild
      mannered people can certainly get a kick out of firing bullets. <br><br>As we
      leave both instructors were very nice. First guy didn&#39;t think I was the
      worse student ever and second guy said even though I&#39;m right handed, my
      left eye is more dominant therefore I shoot better using my left hand.<br><br>Fun
      fact: You may not always shoot with your dominant hand. Switch it up and see
      what works best for you. <br><br>The staff here was very helpful and seemed
      to enjoy teaching their students. <br><br>It&#39;s a great experience to have,

      to expect- it was a pleasant experience. The staff was great especially Johnson
      who was very accommodating to all my questions and needs. He certainly went
      beyond the typical customer service-he made me feel comfortable, gave great
      direction. He is an asset to your business. As I sometimes say &#34;He&#39;s
      definitely a Keeper&#34;. Prior to my visit I spoke to Tai on the phone and
      she answered all my questions and gave me step by step instructions with what
      I needed to get done. Two Thumbs up!!

      weird as we told someone when we walked in that we were there for the shooting
      class, and he told us the instructor would come to us. Then we waited and waited
      and nobody came, so I went to ask again and someone was eating his breakfast
      behind the counter, who turned out to be our instructor and he was confused
      because nobody told him there&#39;s a class. Clearly there was some miscommunication.<br><br>Usually
      when that happens I automatically drop a star, but Jonathan, the instructor,
      was amazing. Maybe we lucked out during the holidays because it was just us
      in the class. I was a little nervous about holding a real gun and the whole
      loading/offloading bullets and turning on and off safety started all sounding
      very confusing to me. Jonathan was very patient with us. We also asked about
      gun laws in the city, which we were curious and he seemed to be a walking encyclopedia
      on gun laws. <br><br>After that, we went off to the range and each got 50 rounds
      at targets. Jonathan was standing by the whole time, checking our aims and poses.
      It&#39;s a lot less scary once you started shooting, and it was really really
      fun. The rifles they use for first timers had minimum recoil as well. Ladies,
      give it a try if you are looking for a fun date!

      3 years now and I can&#39;t imagine going anywhere else. From the moment you
      walk in to the moment you leave, the incredible staff makes you feel so comfortable,
      as if you were family.<br><br>I recently went to the new location and had a
      fantastic facial. They somehow figured out a way to take all of the wonderful
      things from the old studio and bring them to life in this new venue. It was
      such a nice reprieve from a stressful day and I can&#39;t wait to go back!

      my gift card expired and was so sad thinking I lost more than $300 in a gift.
      The owners were so kind and they allowed me to use it. I so appreciate them
      for this!!!!<br><br>I had been to their original location and fell in love with
      everything. Yes the relaxation area was AMAZING!!! Their new location is smaller
      and does not have the same comfy couches, but I was okay with. I met with Kathy,
      the owner, who explained to me their current dilemma with their previous location
      and new location. I understood this was temporary and did not mind. <br><br>I
      had a facial and appreciated the feedback she gave me on my skin. I did appreciate
      the products she recommend and happy to have received samples. I also had the
      best massage. I was first asked what areas were bothersome and then went into
      an hour of bliss. I had my main two areas focused on (back and calves) and then
      the remainder of the body. <br><br>I would definitely go back, without hesitation.
      I think the warmth the owners provide plus the hard work the staff provide,
      show they are determined to make this the best experience in their short term
      setting.<br><br>Also if they have the maple cookies out, try them!! DELICIOUS!!

      massive spa package. The staff is warm and very attentive to make your experience
      the best possible. I think they will always leave me with a lingering memory
      upon my first visit as a young adult, still a teenager. The owner shook hands
      with TWO HANDS, great gratitude there. <br><br>Nonetheless, the massage is definitely
      spot on when you let your massage therapist know the problem areas and how you
      really like it. It is important to remember to guide them before giving them
      a hard time about not getting it right. Following the massage was the Manuka
      Honey facial which really left my face glowing. I am definitely glad I am not
      allergic to honey because this was definitely something that I recommend for
      all! My face is definitely left glowing for days which is tough because typically,
      it wears off for me the next day. Definitely cannot wait for the next spa day
      at Ohm!

      spa places I&#39;ve ever been to and I&#39;m lucky to say that I have been here
      twice. If I was rich (ha ha!) I&#39;d be here at least once a month! <br><br>First
      time coming was last year for a friend&#39;s bachelorette day in the city. We
      reserved massage and facial appointments for each of us (both types for the
      bride) and brought some food in to enjoy in the corner by the lounge (with their
      permission and reservation of course). The ambiance was so relaxing. The calm
      music, the soothing aromas, the comfortable couches.  Everyone loved it, and
      we got to just have some girl time in between appointments over mimosas, drinks,
      hot tea and complimentary snacks. <br><br>This time I went alone with a prenatal
      package gift from hubby. I immediately put my phone away and just enjoyed some
      down time to myself before and in between my massage and facial. For the prenatal,
      I had Rakia (apologies on the misspelling!) As my masseuse. She was AMAZING.
      Accommodating to what I needed and massages at a perfect amount of pressure.
      She ended with a belly rub, which comes with the package. <br><br>After enjoying
      some juice and snacks in between, Aisa took me in for my facial. I learned so
      much from her regarding skin regiment and products. She made sure to use prenatal
      safe products and gave me tips on maintaining hydration the natural way. She
      would make sure I was okay with the products used and adjusted if I needed,
      and at the end gave me a couple samples to take home and try. <br><br>My visit
      ended with a lovely chat with one of the owners, John! It felt as if I knew
      him through our friendly conversation. The whole visit was smooth, service was
      fantastic and I left feeling super relaxed. I would love to be back in the near
      future!

  - :body: I&#39;ve been to the old location of Ohm Spa and had a wonderful experience
      so I was excited to book another 60 minute massage with them.  Upon booking,
      I was told they had moved locations. Sounds good to me!<br><br>Now let me say
      the massage itself was wonderful.  I&#39;m not sure who I had as a therapist
      but she did a good job. My reason for three stars has to do with the new space
      they have.  Their previous location was, in fact, a spa.  Their prices are high
      to begin with, but because they had the lounge and full spa atmosphere it made
      it OK (their prices are on par with Red Door, etc).  HOWEVER, their new location
      is nothing more than an office.  The entire space was dingy and felt dated and
      old. There is no spa lounge.  No amenities.  No front desk check in.  I wasn&#39;t
      offered water or tea upon arrival.  It is essentially a doctor&#39;s office
      waiting room while you wait to be called into your massage room.    That is
      where you change- there is no locker room or spa robes.<br><br>There are plenty
      of wonderful massage places like this across the city and I am a-ok with that.
       However, the prices are generally lower since you aren&#39;t going to a &#34;spa&#34;.
       For this place to move to a office location, get rid of their &#34;spa&#34;
      amenities and still charge $170+  for a massage is ridiculous.  I felt cheated
      out of the spa experience and I certainly did not feel like I had gone to a
      spa.  My massage came to $210 with tip and that&#39;s a lot of money to spend
      for a 60 min swedish massage, much less one that wasn&#39;t at a spa. I left
      feeling uneasy about my experience. <br><br>My advice to Ohm? If your plan is
      to stay at this new location, change your prices to reflect what you are offering.
       <br><br>My advice to anyone looking to book here? This is not a spa.  You can
      find equally good massages at similar environments (non-spas) elsewhere in the
      city and you can go to real spas for about the same price.  <br>I will not be
      back unfortunately.  I used to like you Ohm!

      and he was patient in dealing with that and making sure that everything was
      done properly. I would highly recommend Rich and his shop to anyone who wants

      behind getting repair work done in a fair amount of time &amp; not breaking

      last few months and Jomar has been helping me with many projects, and only now
      I&#39;ve had the chance to write this.<br><br>Jomar is nothing short of amazing.
       He&#39;s incredibly professional, meticulous, patient, courteous, honest, fair
      and simply a great guy to deal with.  He and his team are truly professionals
      and can work on many projects, no matter the task, and do them well.  <br><br>I
      painted my apartment not once, or twice, but three times (!!) in the span of
      a week (... yeah I had a tough time liking the color choice I made) - but Jomar
      and team were totally understanding and worked overtime to keep me happy.  And
      even after painting the apartment a third time, he asked if I was happy or wanted
      to change it.  Like wow!  <br><br>In addition, I&#39;ve worked with Jomar on
      other handyman related work including hanging very large mirrors, installing
      a chandelier, paintings, drapes, and some electrical work.  In the midst of
      all his other projects - I&#39;m sure many larger in scope than mine - he continues
      to find the time to come and help me with my tasks.  (And also FYI the massive

      days are you available, no response. It&#39;s been since yesterday morning.
      Time is money. Even if he needed to think it over, still a long time. At least
      tell me sorry we&#39;re not going to do your job and make up some story, or
      give me a heads up that he hasn&#39;t forgotten about me. With all those great

      room. After hearing great things about Jomar and his company, I hired him to
      come move the chandelier to the new location. He was very efficient, clean and
      friendly. He was able to swap both light fixtures with no issues and he even
      fixed the aesthetics of the chandelier where the original electrician left an
      eyesore of the entire chain hanging. Jomar politely asked if I was happy with
      the length and if he would like me to clean up the chain by removing the excess
      links. Now the light fixture looks awesome in the new room. We couldn&#39;t

      an afternoon cup of coffee. I saw online that Coffee Project looked spacious
      and had a ton of good reviews so decided to give it a visit. I have to say,
      however, that I probably won&#39;t be coming back because of my lukewarm experience.
      <br><br>I ordered a cup of cold brew with some almond milk, which was fine.
      The staff seemed a little cold to me, though the service was fine overall. The
      menu did look interesting, with some food items and also some coffee flights.
      I saw two people doing the flight, which looked interesting - one of the baristas
      explained how to taste the coffee (similar to a wine tasting). <br><br>There
      aren&#39;t too many too many tables in the cafe, and the ones that were there
      were fairly small. The cafe had wifi, but they have a rule that it is a computer-free
      establishment on the weekends. Also, two of the tables in the cafe are reserved
      for customers who are not using laptops. Because I visited on a Sunday and really
      needed to do some work, I ended up leaving after grabbing my coffee to go. <br><br>I
      would suggest potentially giving this cafe a chance if you want to try some
      interesting and trendy drinks, but it is probably not the best spot for working.
      I would say that I also prefer a cozy vibe when I go to a cafe, but this place

      entrance pretty easily.<br><br>For the deconstructed latte, you get sparkling
      water, espresso, milk, latte, and waffle cookie. You&#39;re supposed to drink
      espresso, milk, then latte while having sparkling water in between each to rinse
      the palate. At the end, you finish with the waffle cookie.<br><br>I tried in
      that order and it was an experience. The espresso had some citrusy flavor while
      the milk was warm and sweet. Separately tasting the espresso and milk before
      imagining how the latte came to be was something I never really thought about
      before.<br><br>My favorite part was when I sipped espresso and immediately had
      some milk. I could taste the espresso fading behind the milk until I could only
      taste sweetness with some citrusy notes.<br><br>I wanted to guess the ratio
      of espresso to milk in the latte but I couldn&#39;t really tell.<br><br>Overall
      I gained a greater appreciation for the latte making process. I liked the deconstructed

      why I had to rate this place 3/5 for the lack of good tasting coffee. It was
      extremely mild, even a little bit of added milk made it too milky and more mild.
      I like my coffee on the medium-strong side so because of this preference I didn&#39;t

      on your tongue. I wanted a refill.<br><br>- Latte, probably my favorite out
      of this entire set. It was PERFECT! I enjoyed every sip and took tiny bites
      of the delicious waffle cookie along with my drink. Here is when you taste the
      espresso and the milk come together. <br><br>- Mineral Water, to help you cleanse
      your palette. I thought this was a great idea to add to the set. <br><br>My
      kiddo enjoyed his iced latte and I can tell service was excellent as I heard
      them greet some of their regulars by name.

    :body: I have heard so much about the Coffee Project via Instagram and online
      and I had to try it out. It&#39;s a great cozy cafe with a very welcoming vibe.
      It&#39;s quite small with limited seating so make sure you grab a table when
      you enter. <br>We ordered the deconstructed coffee and a regular coffee. I loved
      the whole feel and the different way to serve coffee and it was a lovely experience
      without a doubt. However, the coffee itself didn&#39;t taste good so that&#39;s
      why I had to rate this place 3/5 for the lack of good tasting coffee. It was
      extremely mild, even a little bit of added milk made it too milky and more mild.
      I like my coffee on the medium-strong side so because of this preference I didn&#39;t
      enjoy the coffee itself. I wish the coffee tasted better and there&#39;s no
      doubt this place would be rated higher.

      croissant.  It&#39;s small with only a few tables, and the signs state to working

  - :body: CASH ONLY FOR DAYTIME!!  My friends and I decided to check out Clinton
      Street Baking Company around 10am on a Friday.  For some reason, the Yelp waitlist
      was not working.  When we got there, the hostess told us it was a 20 minute
      wait, but we only ended up waiting about 10 minutes.  The interior is small
      for a popular brunch place and is like a trendy, upscale diner.  <br><br>We
      ordered the country breakfast (eggs, ham, hash brown, biscuit) ($15) and substituted
      the ham for bacon, blueberry pancakes ($15), and chicken and waffles ($17).
       I personally would not get the country breakfast again.  Eggs were way too
      buttery, the hash brown was not seasoned well and was pretty much just a lump
      of potato, and the biscuit was also bland and dry.  The sugar cured bacon was
      sinfully delicious, but was also on the heavier side.  The fried chicken was
      on the drier side but the seasoning on the chicken was fantastic.  The menu
      advertises a crispy waffle, but the waffle was soft.  The soft waffle is more
      my preference, so I did not mind.  The blueberry pancakes were amazing.  They
      are one of the best pancakes I&#39;ve had in my life.  They were fluffy, moist,
      and had great blueberry flavor without tasting artificial.  We all agreed the
      maple butter was good, but the pancakes could stand on their own.  <br><br>Service
      here is bad.  I don&#39;t know if it was just an off-day, but it seemed like
      the one host was also doubling as the only server.  There were also 2 bussers
      who did not really refill water or bring us extra plates when we asked.  For
      a restaurant this popular, there should be more people on staff.  The slow service
      also probably contributes to a longer wait time.  Although I think the menu
      items here are overpriced, I honestly believe the pancakes are worth every bit
      of the $15 and could eat them over and over again.

  - :body: I was worried this popular breakfast/brunch spot was overhyped - I was
      wrong. It is rightfully hyped. Although the dishes aren&#39;t inventive or creatively
      new (standard brunch fare like blueberry pancakes, chicken &amp; waffles, and
      eggs Benedict), everything is prepared perfectly and with high quality ingredients.
      The ingredients make all the difference - the ham on the eggs Benedict was thick
      and juicy, no large slivers of fat to cut off. The pancakes were light and fluffy
      with a perfect not-too-sweet blueberry compote and rich maple butter syrup.
      Even the side salad was perfectly dressed with a light vinaigrette. I really
      enjoyed breakfast here, and service at the bar was friendly and quick!

    :body: CASH ONLY FOR DAYTIME!!  My friends and I decided to check out Clinton
      Street Baking Company around 10am on a Friday.  For some reason, the Yelp waitlist
      was not working.  When we got there, the hostess told us it was a 20 minute
      wait, but we only ended up waiting about 10 minutes.  The interior is small
      for a popular brunch place and is like a trendy, upscale diner.  <br><br>We
      ordered the country breakfast (eggs, ham, hash brown, biscuit) ($15) and substituted
      the ham for bacon, blueberry pancakes ($15), and chicken and waffles ($17).
       I personally would not get the country breakfast again.  Eggs were way too
      buttery, the hash brown was not seasoned well and was pretty much just a lump
      of potato, and the biscuit was also bland and dry.  The sugar cured bacon was
      sinfully delicious, but was also on the heavier side.  The fried chicken was
      on the drier side but the seasoning on the chicken was fantastic.  The menu
      advertises a crispy waffle, but the waffle was soft.  The soft waffle is more
      my preference, so I did not mind.  The blueberry pancakes were amazing.  They
      are one of the best pancakes I&#39;ve had in my life.  They were fluffy, moist,
      and had great blueberry flavor without tasting artificial.  We all agreed the
      maple butter was good, but the pancakes could stand on their own.  <br><br>Service
      here is bad.  I don&#39;t know if it was just an off-day, but it seemed like
      the one host was also doubling as the only server.  There were also 2 bussers
      who did not really refill water or bring us extra plates when we asked.  For
      a restaurant this popular, there should be more people on staff.  The slow service
      also probably contributes to a longer wait time.  Although I think the menu
      items here are overpriced, I honestly believe the pancakes are worth every bit
      of the $15 and could eat them over and over again.

      with a perfect not-too-sweet blueberry compote and rich maple butter syrup.

      (but in an &#34;I&#39;m an adult living my childhood fantasy&#34; kind of way).
      That being said, this museum is interactive and great for all ages. You have
      adults like me running around dodging lasers and 8 year-olds detecting liars.
      One of my favorite rooms was the surveillance one where you had to  pay attention
      to all screens and identify different people or objects. <br><br>One thing puzzling
      about this exhibition is that although there are more than 8 missions, you are
      only allowed to do 8. I am referring to the booths with surveys/activities on
      the screen, not the interactive stuff. The interactive stuff I believe you could
      do as many times as you like (my friend and I went through the laser room 3
      times). <br><br>There is a spacious gift shop and cafe at the end. <br><br>I
      have recommended Spyscape to my friends and they have equally loved their experience
      here as much as I did.

  - :body: This place is both a spy museum and an interactive game. As you enter,
      you are given a wristband that you must scan on the various exhibits. The place
      is split up into several sections that each concentrate on certain fields of
      spying - encryption, surveillance, hacking, and more. Each section has information
      and artifacts that give you a history of that field. For example, the hacking
      section shows famous cases of hackers.<br><br>The real fun is the interactive
      experience. As you make your way throughout the place, you are presented with
      games that will determine how good of a spy you are. There are personality tests
      you must complete. But the real highlights for me were the laser room (where
      you must avoid lasers and hit sensors on the wall) and the surveillance room
      (where you must identify the targets on the monitors). The place is a little
      overpriced though at $39 for general admission.

      &#34;noped&#34; out of there. I just didn&#39;t want to deal with the large
      crowds so I wanted something else. A quick search for other museums led me to
      Spyscape which seemed interesting so I bit the bullet.<br><br>General admission
      is $47. There was also the 007 exhibit but I didn&#39;t have a lot of time to
      do that. After you purchase a ticket you get an identity band on your wrist
      to use to take some tests to determine what kind of spy you are.<br><br>You
      walk around the museum reading about different topics like encryption, deception,
      and intelligence. You learn about the history of spies and the progression and
      development of spy equipment. You learn about the use of spy equipment in wars
      in history. There are some challenges and activities that are very interactive
      and engaging. At the end you get your spy profile to see what spy role would
      best fit you. It&#39;s really like a personality test and it was pretty accurate
      for me.<br><br>Overall it took an hour and a half for me to get through all
      of it. The subject itself is more appealing and interesting to me than natural
      history so I&#39;m glad I came here instead.<br><br>Also, they have free bag

       I also liked the themes like WW II and learning about famous hackers. It was
      neat, organized, and everything looked like it was kept very clean. The staff
      was very friendly and getting a ticket was painless, entry was quick also.  I
      feel like the price is a little high,  I paid 47 dollars after it was all said
      and done.  I would have been happy paying 35, even 40, but 47 seemed like a
      little much. I spent a good 1.5 hours here but I did rush a little so I could
      get home earlier. Had  I taken my time,  I probably would have spent another
      30 min or so reading through all the interesting materials.  I also liked the
      historical artifacts that they had, it was a nice touch that went hand in hand
      with the interactive stuff. They had some really interesting facts, also!<br><br>The
      reason  I am giving it a 4 is because I&#39;m unsure how accurate the end results
      are. I know it&#39;s all for fun, but  I did all of the stuff and  I want to
      know what  I actually achieved!  I scanned my wrist band two times, and each
      time I got a different set of skills that  I excelled in, not even 1 of the
      3 skills were the same either go around, so that was certainly disappointing

      to do inside as it was a bit chilly, this place had some great reviews so we
      decided to check it out and boy were we happy with our experience.  <br><br>The
      place is not too far from Time Square and upon entering one of the security
      guards let us know that we could save about $5 if we purchased our tickets online
      so we did just that.  With fees it was about $86 for 2 adult tickets which is
      a little pricey in my opinion, however knowing you are in NYC you expect pricey,
      and the museum was really cool, interactive and fun, which made it worth it.
       <br><br>They had free lockers with set your own combination locks which was
      a nice little touch.  Then they gave us a bracelet to connect to the interactive
      exhibits and we watched the debriefing video while riding the elevator up before
      we started our mission.  Your bracelet allows you to create a spy profile by
      taking you through a variety of questions, puzzles and activities that test
      your risk tolerance.  <br><br>There are also 4 sections of the museum that have
      some interesting spy, hacking and espionage exhibits and information, each with
      an interactive event to go through.  My favorites were the surveillance room,
      and the laser tunnel.  That one really makes you feel like a real spy.<br><br>After
      you complete all the challenges, your profile and learn some interesting information
      they give you a spy profile and tell you what spy job you were most suited for
      which was fun.  We were there about 2.5-3 hours, we had small waits and some
      of the parts, and for a little while the places to work on your personality
      and spy profile weren&#39;t working, but they got them back up in action relatively

      You receive a personalized ID band at check-in and use it to activate every
      activity. The activities vary and include personality questions, IQ tests, risk
      analyses, word decoding, laser dodging, and observational tests. I thought the
      IQ tests were the toughest - major throwback to the SAT.<br><br>They clearly
      put a lot of effort into making the place seem high tech, with the large elevator
      room that brings you upstairs to the personalized ID bands. I&#39;m typically

      remember seeing it on the news one day a while back. The check in process was
      pretty fast since we were preregistered. Your ticket is an ID band that you
      use to activate activities and use for question stations where you are tested
      on risk, IQ and other factors. In case you do need to store your stuff away
      their &#34;coat room&#34; is a room of self store lockers with a built in punch
      code locker. <br><br>You are guided into the elevator to the main floor of all
      the activities after watching a short video about espionage. I thought that
      it was cool based on your question results and the two activities (encoding
      messages, lie detector room and the laser wall) that they rate what type of
      spy you are. Although I had to admit some of the IQ questions were quite difficult
      to solve. <br><br>It was neat to see some of the history, stories and some artifacts
      from real life cases that had happened, but if you are comparing it to the spy
      museum in DC, this one is more an interactive experience with activities than
      a full museum showing espionage. It would be neat if they did expand to show
      some more of that.<br><br>I did think it was neat that the gift shop was separated
      in sections based on what type of spy you were. <br><br>Overall it is probably
      a fun activities for kids. Best bet to go is probably earlier in the day if
      you don&#39;t want it to be too crowded. We went when it opened on a Sunday,
      so it wasn&#39;t too busy until when we were leaving. Is it fun? Yes, but buying
      tickets can be a little overpriced. I would say it&#39;s more fair if it was

    :body: I had a great time here.  I really enjoyed all of the interactive stations!
       I also liked the themes like WW II and learning about famous hackers. It was
      neat, organized, and everything looked like it was kept very clean. The staff
      was very friendly and getting a ticket was painless, entry was quick also.  I
      feel like the price is a little high,  I paid 47 dollars after it was all said
      and done.  I would have been happy paying 35, even 40, but 47 seemed like a
      little much. I spent a good 1.5 hours here but I did rush a little so I could
      get home earlier. Had  I taken my time,  I probably would have spent another
      30 min or so reading through all the interesting materials.  I also liked the
      historical artifacts that they had, it was a nice touch that went hand in hand
      with the interactive stuff. They had some really interesting facts, also!<br><br>The
      reason  I am giving it a 4 is because I&#39;m unsure how accurate the end results
      are. I know it&#39;s all for fun, but  I did all of the stuff and  I want to
      know what  I actually achieved!  I scanned my wrist band two times, and each
      time I got a different set of skills that  I excelled in, not even 1 of the
      3 skills were the same either go around, so that was certainly disappointing
      to me.

      to do inside as it was a bit chilly, this place had some great reviews so we
      decided to check it out and boy were we happy with our experience.  <br><br>The
      place is not too far from Time Square and upon entering one of the security
      guards let us know that we could save about $5 if we purchased our tickets online
      so we did just that.  With fees it was about $86 for 2 adult tickets which is
      a little pricey in my opinion, however knowing you are in NYC you expect pricey,
      and the museum was really cool, interactive and fun, which made it worth it.
       <br><br>They had free lockers with set your own combination locks which was
      a nice little touch.  Then they gave us a bracelet to connect to the interactive
      exhibits and we watched the debriefing video while riding the elevator up before
      we started our mission.  Your bracelet allows you to create a spy profile by
      taking you through a variety of questions, puzzles and activities that test
      your risk tolerance.  <br><br>There are also 4 sections of the museum that have
      some interesting spy, hacking and espionage exhibits and information, each with
      an interactive event to go through.  My favorites were the surveillance room,
      and the laser tunnel.  That one really makes you feel like a real spy.<br><br>After
      you complete all the challenges, your profile and learn some interesting information
      they give you a spy profile and tell you what spy job you were most suited for
      which was fun.  We were there about 2.5-3 hours, we had small waits and some
      of the parts, and for a little while the places to work on your personality
      and spy profile weren&#39;t working, but they got them back up in action relatively
      quickly.<br><br>If you are looking for a fun, unique, interactive museum in

    :body: I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect from this place but it exceeded anything
      I had imagined. Great place to hang with friends or go on a fun date! We came
      at 4PM on a Saturday and it was really busy. We were here for about two hours
      total. There&#39;s a complimentary locker room by check-in so you don&#39;t
      have to take your coats or bags with you (highly recommend using this).<br><br>The
      activities you go through are actually quite tough so I don&#39;t recommend
      coming here with children, although we saw plenty of families roaming about.
      You receive a personalized ID band at check-in and use it to activate every
      activity. The activities vary and include personality questions, IQ tests, risk
      analyses, word decoding, laser dodging, and observational tests. I thought the
      IQ tests were the toughest - major throwback to the SAT.<br><br>They clearly
      put a lot of effort into making the place seem high tech, with the large elevator
      room that brings you upstairs to the personalized ID bands. I&#39;m typically
      not into museums but they made the information interesting and engaging and
      interspersed it with a diversity of activities.<br><br>Not exactly a place I&#39;d
      bring visiting friends since I do think it&#39;s a bit pricey for what it is
      but it was fun for a chill activity on a wintery weekend!

    :comment: Your Spyscape identity badge
    :body: I went here with my sister after she won tickets to this attraction. I
      remember seeing it on the news one day a while back. The check in process was
      pretty fast since we were preregistered. Your ticket is an ID band that you
      use to activate activities and use for question stations where you are tested
      on risk, IQ and other factors. In case you do need to store your stuff away
      their &#34;coat room&#34; is a room of self store lockers with a built in punch
      code locker. <br><br>You are guided into the elevator to the main floor of all
      the activities after watching a short video about espionage. I thought that
      it was cool based on your question results and the two activities (encoding
      messages, lie detector room and the laser wall) that they rate what type of
      spy you are. Although I had to admit some of the IQ questions were quite difficult
      to solve. <br><br>It was neat to see some of the history, stories and some artifacts
      from real life cases that had happened, but if you are comparing it to the spy
      museum in DC, this one is more an interactive experience with activities than
      a full museum showing espionage. It would be neat if they did expand to show
      some more of that.<br><br>I did think it was neat that the gift shop was separated
      in sections based on what type of spy you were. <br><br>Overall it is probably
      a fun activities for kids. Best bet to go is probably earlier in the day if
      you don&#39;t want it to be too crowded. We went when it opened on a Sunday,
      so it wasn&#39;t too busy until when we were leaving. Is it fun? Yes, but buying
      tickets can be a little overpriced. I would say it&#39;s more fair if it was
      a bit cheaper.

  - :body: It was on a Sunday early evening, I was frantically trying to find a pet
      store that carries a specific brand of dog food. I called the store and was
      greeted by a very friendly male staff who said he&#39;ll wait for me despite
      they were closing soon. I was so grateful and amazed at the customer service
      they provided not knowing if I&#39;ll really come. <br><br>So I ran over there
      with my dog and the store had a very good selection of food, toys, and everything
      you need to be the perfect dog mom/dad. The male staff informed me that even
      if they don&#39;t carry a brand you&#39;re looking for, they can order them
      for you. Highly recommend this place for all your dog needs in JC!

      more. This place is stocked with any supplies you might need for your dog (or
      cat), and I find that it has even more variety than you might find at a bigger
      retailer like PetSmart or PetCo. They have leashes, toys, food, treats, collars,
      apparel -- you name it, they probably have it. I definitely recommend Fussy
      Friends if you&#39;re a dog owner looking to support a small, local business.
      It&#39;s also located along the Newark Ave pedestrian plaza/walking distance
      from the Grove Street PATH, so you can stop by on the way home or if you&#39;re
      already in the area for the farmer&#39;s market. <br><br>From what I hear, they
      even hold cat adoptions at this location (not sure if they still do, but I know
      they used to), and I support any business that encourages rescue and adoption
      (adopt don&#39;t shop!).

      I tried to walk into fussy friends to escape the other dog (now being held by

      My girlfriend&#39;s dad reached out to her because she was the broker listed
      on a unit we were interested in. Within minutes she called back and started
      getting to know us and what types of apartments we were looking for. It didn&#39;t
      take long for us to decide to work with her and Cooper &amp; Cooper. From that
      point on, whenever we had questions about listings or the renting process, we
      could always count on an immediate answer, or an assurance that she would find
      the answer for us.<br><br>Her deep understanding of the nuances of renting in
      NYC was also apparent. Prior to and during our visit, she explained the details
      of each neighborhood, proximity to transportation/laundromats/grocery stores/etc.,
      and even which landlords she knew and would/would not recommend, among many
      other things. In one day she showed us about ten different places and we found
      a wonderful 1BR into which we&#39;ll be moving in less than a week!<br><br>We
      recently signed our lease and Diane continues to check in and answer our questions
      regularly, ensuring that our move goes smoothly. She has really showed us how

      a link to a building on StreetEasy and she mentioned that while it was a cool
      building, it was right next a construction site which would ruin our views and
      living experience.  <br><br>I think what really stood out the most was her willingness
      to bargain with management companies. We went to visit a luxury building that
      had a room within our price range, but she felt one of the rooms was too small
      and asked to see a larger unit. The price went up obviously, but she was confident
      that she could haggle the rent down to our range if we were interested, given
      renovations that were happening in the building. Based on the conversation she
      had with the management representative she did seem very able to do this. <br><br>All

      with him and Cooper &amp; Cooper highly enough.<br><br>About two months ago,
      I accepted a job in NYC, and had to find an apartment and move within a month.
      Khaled was actually recommended to me by a woman I sat next to on my flight
      to La Guardia, and I&#39;m so glad I took her advice. <br><br>Khaled was incredibly
      conscientious of my price range, work location, and desired amenities. I never
      once felt like I was being pressured to spend more or hurry up and decide, which
      would have been very easy for him to do based on a poor experience I had with
      a different broker.<br><br>Khaled was shockingly prompt and responsive to my
      time frame. He returned my introductory text within the hour, and after a few
      texts and emails, we agreed to view apartments two days later.<br><br>While
      viewing apartments, Khaled was generous with his time, promptly guided me between
      showings, and answered all my questions and inspected the apartments alongside
      me. He was extremely friendly and polite, and really made me feel welcome as
      I was moving to a new city.<br><br>Long story short, I ended up signing a lease
      for the last apartment we viewed, a great studio that matched all my requested
      specifications for almost $500 less per month than I had expected to spend!
      During the lease signing process (conducted the day of the viewing), Khaled
      actually helped me review all the documentation I was signing and argued on
      my behalf with the management agency as they reviewing my information. Two day
      later, the management office accepted my application, and two after that I grabbed
      the keys and moved in to my excellent apartment without a hitch.<br><br>I see
      a lot of people refusing to pay broker fees when apartment hunting in New York.
      I know I was shocked at first, and Lord knows I&#39;d rather not spend an extra
      month&#39;s rent if I can help it. <br><br>But Khaled&#39;s fee, fixed at a
      below-average 10% per C&amp;C&#39;s company standards, was worth every penny.
      Without him, I&#39;d be stressed out of my mind trying to navigate shady real
      estate agencies and wondering if I&#39;d made the best move. With the money
      I&#39;m saving on my reduced rent, it&#39;s paid for itself already.<br><br>So
      yes, I&#39;d recommend C&amp;C without hesitation, and when you call them, ask
      for Khaled. Can&#39;t say enough nice things about my experience, and I hope
      your move to NYC is as smooth as mine!

      and Cooper &amp; Cooper enough.<br><br>Apartment hunting is a stressful nightmare
      in New York City--somehow, Yiwen managed to turn the whole process into a fun,
      stress free outing that resulted in a great apartment and zero regrets. She
      truly is an amazing person and broker. Even with extremely late notice (1 day
      to be exact), she took the time to really ask and think about our needs and
      put together a wonderful tour of apartments that checked all our boxes. There
      was no question that we were seeing the best out of the best, which made the
      decision once we found one we really liked that much easier.<br><br>She also
      took the time to personally call my roommates parents, our guarantors, who were
      a little nervous about renting in the city for the first time. That extra care
      really matters and ultimately made the process so much easier. Not often do
      you get a broker willing to call parents at 8am to explain the paperwork process
      in detail!<br><br>At the beginning of the day, Yiwen expressed her specific
      interest in the last apartment on the tour. She explained that it seemed like
      a really good fit for our needs and we should continue on with the tour and
      see all the options even if we have a good feeling about a previous apartment
      earlier in the day. Her advice was spot on! Further proving she is an expert
      in her field. We ended up visiting the last apartment and loving it! There were
      zero doubts it was the perfect place. Yiwen also personally ran with me to the
      bank to get a good faith deposit before they closed. Talk about a bonding experience!<br><br>I&#39;ve
      met a lot of brokers in my day that simply open the door, barely show you apartment
      and expect money. It was extremely refreshing to work with such an honest, professional
      broker that took the time to ensure it was not only a successful experience
      but a fun one.<br><br>I cannot express my gratitude enough for Yiwen. Thank
      you for everything! You&#39;re a class act! Highly highly recommend!

  - :body: I used Cooper &amp; Cooper at the recommendation of a close friend, and
      they were fantastic. I worked with Eric Brown. We had a call to discuss what
      I was looking for. And then we set up a day to tour different areas of NYC that
      would meet my needs. <br><br>On the given day, Eric was prepared, educated,
      and enjoyable to be with. We saw perhaps ~20 possible spots in one day, which
      greatly helped me to fine-tune what I was looking for.<br><br>As it turned out,
      my preferences changed after I spent more time looking at the options available,
      and I thus ended up going with a place that Cooper &amp; Cooper did not show
      me. However, that is due to my changing preferences, rather than any issue with
      them. I would strongly recommend Cooper &amp; Cooper to anyone looking for guidance
      in the crazy real estate hunt!

      shoe resoled. He is also open late and it&#39;s never too busy so I get seen

      a few other planners via phone, I knew Firefly was the right choice for me.
      The conversation was so easy, they were very approachable, and best of all,
      got me so excited about planning.<br><br>The best way to explain my experience
      with Firefly is EASY. They made every single part of planning our wedding so
      easy on me. From researching and booking vendors to the day of timeline was
      not only headache free, but fun. I had an absolute blast planning our wedding.
      The entire process was perfectly seamless. There was never a time that Firefly
      made me feel anxious or nervous and never made me aware of anything negative
      that might have happened. Communication was always on point, they always kept
      me on track with contracts and other deliverables that I had to do, and always
      kept things moving at a really great pace. My favorite part of planning was
      the design. I remember getting the design boards through email and getting so
      excited because I knew then that my vision for our wedding was going to be executed.<br><br>We
      had a weekend full of events and every single one was perfect. The timeline
      was so well done and everything was in place so that when we arrived in California
      (destination wedding), all we had to do was enjoy our events and our guests.
      The team was always around to answer any questions I had and to let me know
      that all was being taken care of. Words literally can&#39;t describe how happy
      I was with our wedding weekend. It was absolutely perfect, more than I could
      have imagined and our guests also loved all of the little details that we had
      a blast putting together. Six months later and I&#39;m still having major wedding
      withdrawals! Thank you Firefly for planning our favorite day and weekend so
      perfectly.

      perfect day in our lives! From the moment we hired Firefly, we felt not one
      ounce of stress or worry for our wedding day. Who knew wedding planning could
      be so fun?<br><br>Teissia is the sweetest, most creative, talented and organized
      person and it genuinely shows through her amazing events. She was there every
      single step of the way from the concept and design of the wedding, helping us
      find amazing vendors, organizing and facilitating all vendor meetings, and providing
      us with professional guidance in a non-obtrusive and tasteful way. With my husband
      and I both working full time jobs with a full travel schedule, she made planning
      SO easy and stress free. <br><br>Our wedding was absolutely stunning and flawlessly
      executed and it we owe it all to Teissia&#39;s dedication to ensure that we
      had and ENJOYED the wedding of our dreams. We received overwhelming compliments
      on not only the design details, but how smooth, elegant and effortless the wedding
      day was. It was the best decision we could have ever made to hire Firefly Events
      to plan our wedding and feel so lucky to have worked with them. <br><br>Teissia
      we love you! - Brett and Anthony

  - :body: Planning a wedding is stressful.  Unfortunately for a lot of brides and
      grooms, the stress of the day prevents them from enjoying what should be the
      happiest and most fun day of their lives.  If you are considering planning a
      wedding or event with Firefly, don&#39;t hesitate.  DO IT!  My wife and I worked
      with Firefly for our September 2016 wedding in Charleston.  After we signed
      the contract, we ended up changing our plans multiple times.  In fact, we even
      changed the country we had originally agreed on.  At every step of the process,
      Teissia and her team were kind, understanding, helpful, and, most importantly,
      consummate professionals who navigated obstacles with ease and made the planning
      process exciting for us, not overwhelming.   <br><br>Before talking about the
      actual wedding, it&#39;s worth noting that one of the best parts of working
      with the ladies of Firefly is that, besides being great at their jobs, they&#39;re
      also wonderful people.  My wife and I genuinely consider them friends.  We even
      said at our wedding that if they hadn&#39;t been working there, we would have
      wanted to invite them because we couldn&#39;t imagine the day without them.
       They are cool, funny, smart, and normal (no NYC-style egos or diva behavior).
       You will spend a lot of time communicating with whichever planner you choose,
      so it&#39;s hard to overstate how important it is to actually like them.  Teissia
      and everyone who works for her is a bona fide superstar in terms of both professionalism
      and personality.  <br><br>Finally, the wedding.  Even with all our faith and
      confidence in Firefly, we couldn&#39;t have imagined how beautiful the day would
      turn out.  They anticipated every potential glitch and our every need, and the
      process ran seamlessly.  We were totally unburdened and able to simply enjoy
      our day.  Even our guests remarked that they felt like whenever they had a desire,
      a member of the Firefly team had anticipated it and delivered whatever it was.
       <br><br>It&#39;s unusual to be able to endorse any company without hesitation,
      but Firefly is special.  Teissia puts a premium on kindness, expertise, and
      professionalism, and her example courses through the veins of everyone at the
      company.  We will be forever grateful for having met them, and we can&#39;t
      wait for them to plan birthday parties for our kids!

  - :body: I had quite a long engagement (1.5 years) and Firefly was one of the few
      wedding planners who agreed to work with us the entire time. Many planners would
      only offer a year commitment. <br><br>I like that the girls are younger and
      seem to better understand a young bride&#39;s vision (or at least &#34;young&#34;
      by New York City wedding standards ha). My mother and I had a lot of opinions
      (often differing) and Firefly was able to help manage our differences. <br><br>The
      main thing my husband, my mom, and I appreciated was the day of. Everything
      went perfectly. We felt no stress on our wedding day. I&#39;m sure there were
      all sorts of minor issues popping up behind the scenes, but we didn&#39;t hear
      about (or more importantly see) any of them. Teissia, Gabby, and their team
      took care of everything. I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better day. We felt
      like VIPs, which is how you should feel on your wedding day.

  - :body: A wedding is only as good as the people who plan it! <br>Let me start by
      saying that I know I wasn&#39;t always the EASIEST to work with...coming from
      a design background, I had very high expectations and visions for how I wanted
      things to look. However, when it comes to designing anything for yourself, it
      can get really really hard to narrow things down and actually make decisions.
      I knew I needed to place my faith in a team that would translate and execute
      my vision, and that&#39;s exactly what Firefly did. My husband and I were planning
      an at home wedding with close to 250 guests...it wasn&#39;t an easy event to
      plan, but Alia was there literally, sending me emails and following up on a
      daily basis for close to a year. Whether i wanted to deal with her or not, she
      was ALWAYS a step ahead and took control of everything for me. There may have
      been only one or two days where I didn&#39;t hear from her and that was when
      she was giving birth to her baby, so she was excused! However, that didn&#39;t
      slow her down one bit... <br>Alia and the entire Firefly team were amazing,
      and I&#39;m sure everyone thinks their wedding was truly one of the greatest...
      but this really was....one of the greatest. There were hiccups here and there,
      which is inevitable when planning such a crazy event, but Alia would NEVER present
      an obstacle or issue without a solution already in place.  I wanted a wedding
      in Baltimore, with vendors from up and down he east coast, and Alia made it
      happen. Friends and family have asked when the &#34;reunion&#34; will be...As
      in the anniversary blowout, aka wedding part 2 which Firefly will without a
      doubt be a part of.

      outside it looks super small, it&#39;s so cute on the inside and there&#39;s
      actually a nice area in the back to sit! Its decorated with greenery and lights
      and is so so nice. It definitely has the perfect French summer vibe. <br><br>I
      came here with my friend for a late brunch and were seated after about five
      minutes even though it was pretty busy for a weekday! <br><br>We ordered the
      omelette du juor and bread pudding pancakes. The omelette was stuffed with chicken
      apple sausage, tomatoes, basil and cheese. It was so fluffy and delicious! I&#39;m
      not usually a fan of omelettes but this one definitely pleased my tastebuds.
      It also comes with a side of toast and potatoes! The bread pudding pancakes
      were also delicious. They&#39;re heavier than normal pancakes, which might be
      too much for some people, but I actually really liked them too. The service
      was also super friendly and the portions are HUGE. <br><br>Amongst the plethora
      of brunch spots in SF, Zazie is definitely up there! I absolutely love the ambiance
      of the restaurant, service, and food and will be back!

  - :body: Great brunch- food and service were both top notch! This is a very popular
      brunch spot so you must plan accordingly. They do not take reservations so I
      recommend getting there early to get yourself on the list. I went on a Sunday
      when they opened at 9. I got there at 8:45 and was a solo diner so got in right
      when they opened. If you have a larger party you should plan on getting there
      to put your name on the list around 8:15/8:30. <br><br>Also, the few tables
      in the front are first come first serve so if you get there and one is open,
      sit down! <br><br>Some other cool things about this restaurant- (1) the dishes
      come in sizes (e.g., 1, 2, or 3 pieces of French toast or eggs Benedict). This
      is great because you can try multiple items off the menu. I had both eggs Benedict
      and French toast and both were fantastic. Also, (2) the restaurant pays its
      employees a living wage and benefits so there&#39;s no tipping. The prices are
      a little higher, but worth it to know the employees are compensated appropriately.
      <br><br>Highly highly recommend!

      this place because of the high reviews. We got there pretty early and there
      was already a line out the door. We placed our name on the waiting list and
      waited about 15 mins.<br><br>HOT STEAMED CHAI TEA W/MILK<br>I could taste the
      light chai, but it was nothing spectacular. It was more milky than chai. I was
      hoping for more spice.<br><br>SEASONAL COFFEE CAKE- double lemon coffee cake,
      eureka lemon sour cream pound cake with meyer lemon glaze, and spring blueberry
      sauce<br>This cake was airy and soft. I liked the lemon flavors. It wasn&#39;t
      entirely sweet, but had a tartness to it. The blueberry sauce complemented the
      flavor of the lemon with it&#39;s sweet berry flavor. It was rich in flavor
      and perfect with some coffee.<br><br>MEXICO SCRAMBLED EGGS- chorizo, white cheddar,
      roasted peppers, and salsa with white toast and potatoes<br>The dish looked
      very hearty, but I was expecting more flavors. The eggs were bland. The only
      flavor that came through was the salsa, which had a pico de gallo flavor with
      some saucy, sour spiciness. The dish overall was very oily and greasy; so after
      a couple bites it felt very heavy. I wouldn&#39;t order this again.<br><br>FRESH
      GRILLED AHI TUNA SANDWICH- tomatoes provencales, aioli, and sun dried tomato
      pesto with greens on toasted levain, served with a side salad<br>This dish had
      some interesting flavors. The ahi tuna flavor was light and had a good sear
      to it, but definitely more cooked than fresh. The tomatoes added sweetness to
      the sandwich, which balanced out the cooked flavors of the fish. My favorite
      thing about this dish was the green salad. The dressing was sweet and the vinaigrette
      really elevated the dish.<br><br>Service was really slow, our server disappeared
      a lot, the area is really small and cramped so we were back to back with other
      diners and food is overhyped. I wouldn&#39;t come back here again.

      wait. Zazie&#39;s staff will literally come get you once the table is ready.

      I would have rather had canadian bacon but they didn&#39;t have a benedict option
      with that. Everything was good with one major complaint - the yolk was not runny.
      I&#39;m sorry, but if you pride yourself on your eggs benedict or honestly have
      any ounce of self respect as a bruncher - you gotta have runny yolk with your
      eggs benedict! Mine was still slightly runny, so not completely hard which saved

      this neighborhood restaurant has full benefit and retirement plans for their
      employee! The &#34;tip&#34; is included in their prices.<br><br>I&#39;ve been
      here several times, and I think my favorite so far is one of their Miracle pancakes,
      which changes weekly. The Cinnamon Bun Pancakes with cream cheese glazed, was
      amazing, I would recommend that one if it comes back again, it was sweet and
      soft. This week miracle pancake was the ricotta and lemon pancake. They also
      have the gingerbread pancake and they have this pear on top of it, and I didn&#39;t
      even think that you could pair pancake and pears but it works, I kinda wanted
      more pears! They sell their pancakes by 1/2/3 pieces and they are huge so I
      usually get one and a side, the chicken apple sausage. Their potatoes is also
      very interesting, it&#39;s fried with whole garlics. I&#39;ve also had the Pain
      de Mie French Toast w/ orange cinnamon batter, topped with fresh fruits, it
      was pretty good, I like how light it felt.<br><br>They have the La Mer Eggs
      Benedict with &#34;hand picked California Dungeness crab, avocados, and chives,&#34;

      items on their menus, especially their dinner. It&#39;s such a beautiful restaurant,
      when it&#39;s open I love to sit on their outside patio seating in the back.

      back patio (tables in front are first come first served). I didn&#39;t let all

    :body: The boy and I chose this place for brunch and the first on our list was
      this place because of the high reviews. We got there pretty early and there
      was already a line out the door. We placed our name on the waiting list and
      waited about 15 mins.<br><br>HOT STEAMED CHAI TEA W/MILK<br>I could taste the
      light chai, but it was nothing spectacular. It was more milky than chai. I was
      hoping for more spice.<br><br>SEASONAL COFFEE CAKE- double lemon coffee cake,
      eureka lemon sour cream pound cake with meyer lemon glaze, and spring blueberry
      sauce<br>This cake was airy and soft. I liked the lemon flavors. It wasn&#39;t
      entirely sweet, but had a tartness to it. The blueberry sauce complemented the
      flavor of the lemon with it&#39;s sweet berry flavor. It was rich in flavor
      and perfect with some coffee.<br><br>MEXICO SCRAMBLED EGGS- chorizo, white cheddar,
      roasted peppers, and salsa with white toast and potatoes<br>The dish looked
      very hearty, but I was expecting more flavors. The eggs were bland. The only
      flavor that came through was the salsa, which had a pico de gallo flavor with
      some saucy, sour spiciness. The dish overall was very oily and greasy; so after
      a couple bites it felt very heavy. I wouldn&#39;t order this again.<br><br>FRESH
      GRILLED AHI TUNA SANDWICH- tomatoes provencales, aioli, and sun dried tomato
      pesto with greens on toasted levain, served with a side salad<br>This dish had
      some interesting flavors. The ahi tuna flavor was light and had a good sear
      to it, but definitely more cooked than fresh. The tomatoes added sweetness to
      the sandwich, which balanced out the cooked flavors of the fish. My favorite
      thing about this dish was the green salad. The dressing was sweet and the vinaigrette
      really elevated the dish.<br><br>Service was really slow, our server disappeared
      a lot, the area is really small and cramped so we were back to back with other
      diners and food is overhyped. I wouldn&#39;t come back here again.

    :body: Zazie is one of my favorite places in SF. Not only is their brunch delicious,
      this neighborhood restaurant has full benefit and retirement plans for their
      employee! The &#34;tip&#34; is included in their prices.<br><br>I&#39;ve been
      here several times, and I think my favorite so far is one of their Miracle pancakes,
      which changes weekly. The Cinnamon Bun Pancakes with cream cheese glazed, was
      amazing, I would recommend that one if it comes back again, it was sweet and
      soft. This week miracle pancake was the ricotta and lemon pancake. They also
      have the gingerbread pancake and they have this pear on top of it, and I didn&#39;t
      even think that you could pair pancake and pears but it works, I kinda wanted
      more pears! They sell their pancakes by 1/2/3 pieces and they are huge so I
      usually get one and a side, the chicken apple sausage. Their potatoes is also
      very interesting, it&#39;s fried with whole garlics. I&#39;ve also had the Pain
      de Mie French Toast w/ orange cinnamon batter, topped with fresh fruits, it
      was pretty good, I like how light it felt.<br><br>They have the La Mer Eggs
      Benedict with &#34;hand picked California Dungeness crab, avocados, and chives,&#34;
      that was very interesting. Honestly, their food is pretty good, every thing
      I have tried has a unique taste to it, I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more
      items on their menus, especially their dinner. It&#39;s such a beautiful restaurant,
      when it&#39;s open I love to sit on their outside patio seating in the back.
      This place can get pack, either come right when they open on weekdays or at
      odd hours like 1 PM for plenty of seatings.

    :body: I have been wanting to come to Zazie after it popped up in a Facebook video
      I watched about the best brunch places in the city! So glad I finally got to
      check it out! <br><br>Came on a Sunday around 1230 or so. Driving up you can
      see all the people standing outside waiting for tables either inside or on the
      back patio (tables in front are first come first served). I didn&#39;t let all
      the people standing there deter me and I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t! I put my
      name on the list and probably after about a 40 minute wait we were seated! Not
      bad at all! <br><br>I got the mimosa with lavender to start and I really liked
      the taste! I wish it was bottomless! To eat, I got the French toast Tahiti,
      bf got the ranch burger. My only disappointment with my food is there wasn&#39;t
      more! It was really good the bananas and walnuts with the French toast gave
      it a great flavor all it was missing was maybe caramel for a sugar overload!
      It was really delicious. Bf said his burger was OK. He felt it was just a regular
      burger but said he would come back (he&#39;s very tough when it comes to food)!
      Can&#39;t wait to come back to try the other menu items the eggs Benedict was
      walked past me and looked amazing! Ah I wish they had a sampler breakfast platter!
      So many yummy options so hard to pick just one! Until next time<br>Zazie!

  - :body: Do not miss the bacon flight here. *drools*<br><br>I was lucky enough to
      grab brunch here on my most recent visit to SF. This place seems to have a pretty
      long line regularly, so the earlier you can get there, the better. Our group
      of 4 got sat in a corner booth which was cozy. I don&#39;t quite understand
      the theme of the place. Mardi gras beads are strewn around the room, chandeliers
      grace the airspace above you, photos and awards don the walls...it&#39;s a mish-mosh,
      but I can dig an eccentric vibe. It made the space feel homey, even though they
      prob see a TON of visitors due to their accolades for tasty noms. <br><br>We
      started with a big fishbowl drink (fiesta bucket) because...brunch *shrug* No
      regrets! It was delicious! What was in it? Who can remember? All I know is we
      drank it down to the last drop. There was likely a slice of grapefruit in it
      because...there was grapefruit garnish everywhere. I swear everything we ordered
      had grapefruit on the plate. It made every plate insta-worthy for sure, but
      didn&#39;t always add to the taste. Oh well. Just an observation!<br><br>DO
      NOT SKIP THE BACON FLIGHT. The millionaire&#39;s bacon will leave you wanting
      more...so freakin&#39; tasty. It&#39;s coated with brown sugar, pepper, and
      cayenne and it is downright magical. The original is the best, rosemary a close
      second but the citron and cinnamon were fun to try. Basically, this is why you
      stand in line. It&#39;s amazing and 100% worth the wait. If I lived nearby,
      I&#39;d have that ish delivered to my door at least 3x a week. Mag *clap* ic
      *clap* al *clap*<br><br>For my entree, I ordered the belly rancheros and holy
      moly, this is a huge portion! I would recommend planning to share this bad boy.
      The pork belly was excellent and the avo and kimchi just took it next level.
      So so good. Just huge!<br><br>We couldn&#39;t skip the french toast because
      so many Yelpers before us said it was amazing. They didn&#39;t lie, ya&#39;ll.
      That mascarpone filling just oozing out of the perfectly fried french toast...*heart
      eye emoji* Just don&#39;t skip it, k? It&#39;s the perfect plate to split with
      your brunch buds to end the meal. <br><br>This brunch experience was just lovely.
      Definitely recommend anyone heading to the Castro to try this place out!

  - :body: 'I&#39;ve heard a lot about this place so decided to give it a try during
      one of our weekend trips to SF. <br><br>WAIT: We came on a Wednesday morning
      around 11:30 AM and waited about 15 minutes for a table of 3, as expected. The
      place was pretty poppin&#39; so I can&#39;t imagine the weekend wait. <br><br>SERVICE:
      Servers were friendly for the most part, but were a little tough to flag down
      at times. Like other reviews said, this place is busy but it does seem like
      they tend to disappear for long periods of time. <br><br>ENVIRONMENT/AMBIANCE:
      So at first we were seated in the corner by the bathroom in kind of a cramped
      table -- let me tell ya, it was hot back there as it was a crisp 78 degrees
      in San Francisco this day. I literally was sweating just sitting there cause
      that spot doesn&#39;t really get any of the fresh air coming in from the open
      door since it&#39;s nestled in the back. I requested to move to a table that
      just opened up across from it, and it was 100x better since there was more open
      space. This place is also hella loud cause it&#39;s busy so don&#39;t expect
      a peaceful brunch experience.<br><br>FOOD: I ordered the Frisco benedict and
      it was probably a 4/10. It was honestly hard to eat on top of such tough bread,
      and the mango chicken sausage was dry and not anything special. The egg was
      cooked to perfection, but the hollandaise sauce tasted a little off to me. The
      potatoes also needed a copious amount of salt. My friends got the rib-eye omurice
      and said it was pretty good, but a little heavy. <br><br>PRICE: Eh. Typical
      brunch prices, as to be expected. I don&#39;t know if I would say it&#39;s totally
      worth the money here since I&#39;ve had better experiences in other places,
      so I don&#39;t really get the hype, but maybe I didn&#39;t order the right thing.
      <br><br>Willing to give it another shot, but wasn&#39;t as in love with this
      place as I expected to be.'

  - :body: I came here because the yelp reviews were really high. But overall really
      disappointed with my visit. There&#39;s always a really long line every time
      I past this place so we had really high hopes coming in.<br><br>The wait was
      about 30 minutes to get a table for 3 on a Sunday around 1 o clock. I think
      if you have a party of 1 or 2 it&#39;s much shorter because there&#39;s a bar.
      So I was waiting in line and the hostess asked me how many people was in my
      party and I said three, the people behind me had three people as well. When
      it came time a table was ready and the hostess took the party behind me first
      even though I had clearly been waiting before them. So I had to talk to the
      other hostess and told him that I was waiting before those people but the other
      hostess took them in first. He apologized but didn&#39;t do anything to rectify
      the situation. He just said that he can&#39;t do anything about it and that
      there would be a table soon. So basically I waited a few minutes before this
      party and have to wait longer after this party of the table. That doesn&#39;t
      seem fair. <br><br>But we were all hungry so we didn&#39;t try to escalate the
      situation. <br><br>The rest of our visit was very typical--nothing spectacular
      nor out of the ordinary. <br><br>My friends got the million dollar Bloody Mary
      and it straight up tasted like salsa. Not sure if that was what it was supposed
      to taste like but I was not a fan. The bacon however was probably the best part
      of the drink. It was sweet and thick. <br><br>I ordered the deep fried French
      toast. I wasn&#39;t sure what I was expecting but it was extremely heavy and
      sweet--though the first bite was pretty good, I couldn&#39;t keep eating it
      because it was so dense with sugar. I ended up paying about $22 for my food
      and drink. Honestly not worth the wait in my opinion. I think this place is
      famous because brunch is a huge thing. <br><br>Over all I&#39;d give this place
      0 stars if I could.

  - :body: I visited this restaurant that has been sitting in my bucket list of go-to
      bookmarks for eons, it finally made the cut! It was an impromptu last minute
      decision, entertaining some guests from out of town and in need of a late night
      foodie spot. Open late night -check. <br><br>   The interior is rustic modern
      trendy- picnic type tables, benches with accent pillows, fresh flowers here
      &amp; there, title work, interesting art &amp; wall hangings, the hanging mason
      jar lighting etc. The menu has a whole host of eclectic items, most leaning
      toward Asian fusion, but with a Hash House a go-go vibe- over the top and in
      your face flavors. <br><br>   Everything we ordered was delightful. It&#39;s
      worth a visit once. Nothing in particular would make me go out of my way to
      revisit. I was a bit frustrated they forget to put in an order of ribs that
      we sat and waited quite some time for, before they noticed they forgot an entree.
      <br><br>    All in all the food is decent and keeping up with the trendy comfort
      style Asian fusion.

  - :body: Officially my new fav brunch place in the bay ^__^<br><br>Came in a party
      of 3 around 12pm on a Wednesday and was expecting to have to wait a while, but
      actually got seated within 5-10 mins. We ordered the 2 most popular items on
      yelp - mascarpone stuffed deep fried French toast and ribeye omurice. Both were
      INSANELY bomb and portions were actually pretty large. The three of us were
      full after sharing just those two dishes, which came out to be around $14 per
      person after tax and tip. <br><br>The French toast is so dense and thicccc.
      The outside has the perfect crunch but the inside is sooo fluffy and delicious
      with mascarpone (a type of Italian cream cheese). And once I found the scoop
      of honey butter on the plate and spread it on, holy shit it changed the game.
      I would drive all the way from SJ to SF again just for the French toast honestly.<br><br>The
      omurice is really bomb too, although I def like the French toast more. There&#39;s
      barely any meat despite the name &#34;ribeye omurice&#34;, but still hella worth
      it. Amazing flavors and the egg had the perf texture. Even the potatoes, sweet
      potatoes, and carrots on the side were so good, and I don&#39;t even like sweet
      potatoes and carrots. <br><br>Service was okay, and parking wasn&#39;t too bad
      at the time I went cause there were a few street parking spots within 2 blocks
      of the restaurant. The restaurant also has a really cute vibe/aesthetic, and
      they give you your check on a novel which is kinda quirky.<br><br>Great location
      too cause there&#39;s Bi-Rite Creamery within walking distance for dessert,
      and mission Dolores park right next to bi-rite if you wanna walk off the calories!

      and the service here is great. It&#39;s a busy area so parking can be difficult.
      I usually Uber so I don&#39;t pave to deal with parking and so I can partake
      in the bottomless mimosas for $22! They also offer tons of other drinks here
      from Bloody Mary&#39;s to specialty coffee drinks. It&#39;s a really fun place
      to go but beware that you might be waiting more than an hour for a table if
      you get here after 9:30am and/or if you&#39;re in a large group. <br><br>My
      absolute FAVORITE items on the menu have to be the Mascarpone Stuffed French
      Toast and the Millionaires Bacon. If you&#39;re anything like me sometimes it&#39;s
      hard to decide if you want sweet or savory for breakfast. Here I get the best
      of both worlds and order the French Toast with a side of Millionaires bacon.
       The French Toast is crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.
      The mascarpone stuffed inside has just the right amount of sweetness. The Millionaires
      Bacon  is the gold standard of all bacon. Wonderful thick slabs of glorious
      meat cooked and seasoned to perfection. Just the right amount of sweetness from
      the maple to compliment the savory saltiness of the pork. Another cool thing
      they offer here is a bacon flight including the regular millionaires bacon,
      rosemary, citron, and cinnamon. Do yourself a favor and try the rosemary bacon!!!
      It is amazing, I could eat a whole plate of it myself.<br><br>Despite the long
      lines Kitchen Story keeps me coming back again and again. The inside is cute,
      cozy, clean, and the food is outstanding. I can&#39;t wait to come here again!

    :body: Do not miss the bacon flight here. *drools*<br><br>I was lucky enough to
      grab brunch here on my most recent visit to SF. This place seems to have a pretty
      long line regularly, so the earlier you can get there, the better. Our group
      of 4 got sat in a corner booth which was cozy. I don&#39;t quite understand
      the theme of the place. Mardi gras beads are strewn around the room, chandeliers
      grace the airspace above you, photos and awards don the walls...it&#39;s a mish-mosh,
      but I can dig an eccentric vibe. It made the space feel homey, even though they
      prob see a TON of visitors due to their accolades for tasty noms. <br><br>We
      started with a big fishbowl drink (fiesta bucket) because...brunch *shrug* No

    :body: I came here because the yelp reviews were really high. But overall really
      disappointed with my visit. There&#39;s always a really long line every time
      I past this place so we had really high hopes coming in.<br><br>The wait was
      about 30 minutes to get a table for 3 on a Sunday around 1 o clock. I think
      if you have a party of 1 or 2 it&#39;s much shorter because there&#39;s a bar.
      So I was waiting in line and the hostess asked me how many people was in my
      party and I said three, the people behind me had three people as well. When
      it came time a table was ready and the hostess took the party behind me first
      even though I had clearly been waiting before them. So I had to talk to the
      other hostess and told him that I was waiting before those people but the other
      hostess took them in first. He apologized but didn&#39;t do anything to rectify
      the situation. He just said that he can&#39;t do anything about it and that
      there would be a table soon. So basically I waited a few minutes before this
      party and have to wait longer after this party of the table. That doesn&#39;t
      seem fair. <br><br>But we were all hungry so we didn&#39;t try to escalate the
      situation. <br><br>The rest of our visit was very typical--nothing spectacular
      nor out of the ordinary. <br><br>My friends got the million dollar Bloody Mary
      and it straight up tasted like salsa. Not sure if that was what it was supposed
      to taste like but I was not a fan. The bacon however was probably the best part
      of the drink. It was sweet and thick. <br><br>I ordered the deep fried French
      toast. I wasn&#39;t sure what I was expecting but it was extremely heavy and
      sweet--though the first bite was pretty good, I couldn&#39;t keep eating it
      because it was so dense with sugar. I ended up paying about $22 for my food
      and drink. Honestly not worth the wait in my opinion. I think this place is
      famous because brunch is a huge thing. <br><br>Over all I&#39;d give this place
      0 stars if I could.

      bookmarks for eons, it finally made the cut! It was an impromptu last minute
      decision, entertaining some guests from out of town and in need of a late night
      foodie spot. Open late night -check. <br><br>   The interior is rustic modern
      trendy- picnic type tables, benches with accent pillows, fresh flowers here
      &amp; there, title work, interesting art &amp; wall hangings, the hanging mason
      jar lighting etc. The menu has a whole host of eclectic items, most leaning
      toward Asian fusion, but with a Hash House a go-go vibe- over the top and in
      your face flavors. <br><br>   Everything we ordered was delightful. It&#39;s
      worth a visit once. Nothing in particular would make me go out of my way to
      revisit. I was a bit frustrated they forget to put in an order of ribs that
      we sat and waited quite some time for, before they noticed they forgot an entree.
      <br><br>    All in all the food is decent and keeping up with the trendy comfort
      style Asian fusion.

      of 3 around 12pm on a Wednesday and was expecting to have to wait a while, but
      actually got seated within 5-10 mins. We ordered the 2 most popular items on
      yelp - mascarpone stuffed deep fried French toast and ribeye omurice. Both were
      INSANELY bomb and portions were actually pretty large. The three of us were
      full after sharing just those two dishes, which came out to be around $14 per
      person after tax and tip. <br><br>The French toast is so dense and thicccc.
      The outside has the perfect crunch but the inside is sooo fluffy and delicious
      with mascarpone (a type of Italian cream cheese). And once I found the scoop
      of honey butter on the plate and spread it on, holy shit it changed the game.
      I would drive all the way from SJ to SF again just for the French toast honestly.<br><br>The
      omurice is really bomb too, although I def like the French toast more. There&#39;s
      barely any meat despite the name &#34;ribeye omurice&#34;, but still hella worth
      it. Amazing flavors and the egg had the perf texture. Even the potatoes, sweet
      potatoes, and carrots on the side were so good, and I don&#39;t even like sweet
      potatoes and carrots. <br><br>Service was okay, and parking wasn&#39;t too bad
      at the time I went cause there were a few street parking spots within 2 blocks
      of the restaurant. The restaurant also has a really cute vibe/aesthetic, and
      they give you your check on a novel which is kinda quirky.<br><br>Great location

      and mission Dolores park right next to bi-rite if you wanna walk off the calories!

      of both worlds and order the French Toast with a side of Millionaires bacon.
       The French Toast is crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.
      The mascarpone stuffed inside has just the right amount of sweetness. The Millionaires

      reviews. This was a fantastic experience.<br><br>We ordered a sashimi platter,
      soft shell crab, and their steak with wasabi noodles.<br><br>The platter consisted
      of four different kinds of fish (salmon, fatty tuna, and I can&#39;t remember
      the last two). The sashimi was fresh and buttery. We ate the soft shell crab
      too quickly to remember to take a picture of it. It was crispy, soft, and well-seasoned.
      Lastly, the steak was perfectly cooked, but I could&#39;ve done without the
      wasabi noodles. They were good, but not anything very memora.<br><br>Be aware

      start we had the roasted oysters.  They were very fresh, but they were topped

      changed out the wasabi noodles for garlic noodles and steak.  The noodles were
      very good and the steak was cooked to temperature.  The only issue I had was
      the steak knife couldn&#39;t cut the steak.  Seriously, I wish I had brought

      in North Beach in a small building with limited seating and was pretty full
      the entire time we were there.  Easy to see why.  There are quite a few specials
      each night for both appetizers and entrees.  We had the scallop special that
      was wonderful.  Tender and filled with a great flavor.  We also had the shrimp
      dumplings and clams for appetizers.  The two that had clams thought they were
      great and we all liked the dumplings.  My favorite appetizer was the scallops
      though.<br><br>For entrees,  I had the black cod special, two had the wasabi
      noodles with flatiron steak and we all tasted the sea bass with garlic ginger
      soy.  My black cod was flaky and tender and came with wasabi noodles.  The noodles
      are delicious.  The cod was flavored well.  The sea bass was also tender and
      had a good taste.  It also came with the noodles.  <br><br>We were all too full
      for dessert so can&#39;t comment on that though what we saw at other tables

    :body: My friend suggested we try this place on a Friday night. Honestly, after
      looking at the Yelp reviews, I was pretty excited to join the chorus of positive
      reviews. This was a fantastic experience.<br><br>We ordered a sashimi platter,
      soft shell crab, and their steak with wasabi noodles.<br><br>The platter consisted
      of four different kinds of fish (salmon, fatty tuna, and I can&#39;t remember
      the last two). The sashimi was fresh and buttery. We ate the soft shell crab
      too quickly to remember to take a picture of it. It was crispy, soft, and well-seasoned.
      Lastly, the steak was perfectly cooked, but I could&#39;ve done without the
      wasabi noodles. They were good, but not anything very memora.<br><br>Be aware
      that this place is super popular on Friday nights, so expect to wait a little
      while even with a reservation!

    :body: This has to be one of my fav restaurants in all of Fidi/Chinatown/north
      beach. <br><br>They are Asian fusion so expect twists on your fav ethnic dishes.
      I have been here for multiple occasions for dinner and lunch and have never
      been disappointed. <br><br>Some of my all time favorites include:<br>Miso black
      cod <br>Wasabi noodles with salmon <br>Sea bass <br>Scallop Caesar salad <br><br>Honestly
      you can not go wrong with anything here. <br><br>One suggestion to the business
      is to have the daily specials in writing. It&#39;s hard to hear or remember
      when the server is throwing 5-6 specials at you.  <br><br>Other than that, great
      food and great service. They are a small restaurant but they do take reservations!

      start we had the roasted oysters.  They were very fresh, but they were topped
      with a kind of BBQ sauce.  I think it overwhelmed the oysters.  We also had
      the seared scallops, which were juicy and tender.  <br><br>For my entree, I
      changed out the wasabi noodles for garlic noodles and steak.  The noodles were
      very good and the steak was cooked to temperature.  The only issue I had was
      the steak knife couldn&#39;t cut the steak.  Seriously, I wish I had brought
      my own.  <br><br>The Halibut was cooked nicely.  My +1 thoroughly enjoyed her
      dish.  One thing I don&#39;t understand was why they piled such a large amount
      of crispy potatoes on top of my steak and her halibut.  <br><br>Make a reservation

      only downside is that the place is relatively small so it tends to be a bit
      loud and your neighboring table is right next to yours. Also they have these
      delicious pickled cucumbers they serve you when you arrive and if you ask for
      more they will charge $5?!! Kind of ridiculous in my opinion. <br><br>But this
      last time I tried the halibut special which was amazing. But my favorite part
      was their coconut creme brûlée that is so fresh with passion fruit purée on
      top. It is so light and amazing.

  - :body: Liholiho was a dream come true! I had them on my bookmarks list for years
      now, but never had a truly good reason to make a reservation. Fast forward to
      present, the long awaited treat yoself moment was here. My friend made a reservation
      for exactly one month in advance.<br><br>First off, I want to applaud Liholiho
      with their customer service. It&#39;s not often that you feel so welcomed. Even
      though it&#39;s been a month and a half, I still remember the dining experience
      like it was yesterday. The stand out would be the scallops and pork belly. It
      was melt in your mouth delicious. Their brined pork chop was so juicy and I
      loved how they incorporated blueberries into the dish. Unfortunately, I thought
      their housemade spam and kimchi fried rice were mediocre. Their baked hawaii
      and passionfruit cream pound cake was delicious. <br><br>For their dishes, they
      always played on contrasting elements which brought each dish to life. They
      were so careful with the presentation and taste that I feel like they deserve
      all the praise they have been getting.<br><br>Liholiho is now one of my top
      SF restaurants. While not everything was incredible, the pros outweighed the
      cons and I felt so welcomed. I can&#39;t wait to make another reservation and
      come back soon!

      really GREAT!<br><br>1st visit - Came to celebrate my husband&#39;s birthday
      with our 2 kids (5 and 1 year old at the time) we were sat all the way in the
      back of the restaurant closer to the stairway in a booth, which we were so grateful
      for. Never wanna be the parents out with their kids interrupting anyone&#39;s
      date night. This particular night I had a horrible cold and was barely able
      to taste anything and was so sad, but as far as my husbands experience he LOVED
      everything. Presentation was also on point. Staff was very kind and always checking
      in if the kids needed anything. <br><br>2nd visit - came back with a total of
      10 ladies to celebrate my friends birthday at the Ohana table. The Ohana table
      was located right by the entrance by the window with bar stools. I thought it
      was a nice touch that the long table had hooks underneath for coats/purses considering
      our seats had no backs to hang anything on. We had a set menu, served family
      style at $62 a person (excluding tax and gratuity) but this consisted of 3 appetizers,
      2 salads, 3 mains, 2 desserts. We were pretty juiced to be able to sample so
      many great dishes, which I will be getting to.....<br><br>Appetizers:<br>Tuna
      poke on nori cracker - 5/5<br>This was delicious!! Typical poke on a fried tempura
      crusted seaweed. <br>Liver toast- 5/5<br>Loved this so much, I wouldn&#39;t
      mind having this as my main dish. The saltyness from the liver spread complimented
      the pineapples perfectly on the soft brioche toast. <br>Fried Oysters- 3/5<br>This
      was my least favorite and not as memorable as the other two above.<br><br>Salads:<br>Squid
      salad-5/5<br>Phenomenal!!! Definitely would order this again.<br>Watermelon
      salad 4/5<br>This was delicious as well, but I loved the squid salad just a
      tad more.<br><br>Mains:<br>Coconut clam curry- 4/5<br>This contained clams on
      the shell along with a side of freshly made naan bread. I loved the broth and
      the bread together. I couldn&#39;t stop dipping. Yum!<br>Homemade spam-4/5<br>You
      can never go wrong with spam. Tastes even better than the canned version of
      course. Meaty portions. <br>Grilled short rib 5/5<br>I love short rib, prepared
      any way. This was delicious.<br><br>Dessert- <br>Baked Hawaii -4/5<br>Love the
      presentation of this cute little bee hive and the flavors.<br>Coconut Butter
      Mochi -5/5<br>Definitely the crowd favorite! So simple and delicious. I love
      Mochi everything!!<br><br>Overall experience:<br>Great service, super busy restaurant,
      clean restrooms, fantastic food! Definitely worth visiting at least once. I

      and was able to make the reservations for a month out with the security of my
      credit card number! <br><br>The day comes and I am so excited to try this place!
      I was pre-warned that it is very chill not dressy kind of spot. When my husband
      asked slacks, I said NOOOOOOOO<br><br>Parking wasn&#39;t hard. Street parking
      and a garage around the corner! They sat us the minute we have our name. <br><br>I
      ordered the skipper as my cocktail because they said it was their version of
      a mai tai but had amaretto in it which sounded like a cool twist! <br><br>Their
      cocktails are filled with mini ice chips which I love and it was soooo good
      and pretty strong! <br><br>With the help of yelp reviews and picking the servers
      brain about the menu... <br><br>We picked out the tuna poke- it came on crispy
      nori crackers and had this amazing burst of flavor! I highly recommend ordering.
      <br><br>Then second course was the coconut curry clams. They come with this
      freshly baked tasting naan that&#39;s buttery salty yummy tasting and perfect
      for dipping. The clams tasted like a yellow curry Thai dish but BETTER! The
      sauce is so good you just want to drink it!!!! <br><br>Our main main we ordered
      the slab of ribs and the off the menu spam because it comes with steaks of spam
      rather than small cubes! <br><br>Then we looked at the menu some more and decided
      we wanted to try the cauliflower too. The server warned us it was going to be
      a lot of food. <br><br>The spam was so delicious! Perfectly seasoned rice! Slab
      of ribs was HUGE! it&#39;s a SLAB! so tasty ... I only ate one. That big. Sweet
      but spicy but not too spicy! <br><br>The cauliflower had bone marrow hollandaise
      sauce on it.... oh ... my.... gawd so gooooood! Buttery melt in your mouth kind
      of flavor. Rich but not too rich<br><br>Sad to say no room for anything else!

      say it&#39;s safe to say no, but it is safe to say that my party of 4 seasoned
      cocktail drinkers were all extremely unimpressed by them. We all started with
      one, and then moved to beer and wine. We then decided to imbibe downtstairs
      (another review), and we left our $65 worth of cocktails barely touched. They
      were not good. Too sweet, yet contrasting flavors of bitterness? These didn&#39;t
      spark joy and elation, but squinting and yawns. Light on the alcohol, flavors
      weren&#39;t well concocted; I could have done a better job at home and I don&#39;t
      make cocktails. <br><br>But, what was great, was pretty much everything else.
      Between the ambiance and repping some amazing NY hip-hop, the value of the family
      style dishes and food, LihoLiho was still very much enjoyed. I&#39;d for sure
      come again for the eats if I could snag a table. My wonderful husband stayed
      up at midnight a month before to reserve a 4 top at 8pm so we could put the
      kid to bed and schlep in from Berkeley and meet friends, and I&#39;m still so
      glad we made it happen.<br><br>Putting it out there: I&#39;ve been twice before.
      Once at 5pm with coworkers, right when the restaurant opens with what was a
      lucky open table. The second time was a 10pm reservation which again, was probably
      a cancellation and who wants to eat on a Thursday at 10pm. :: People do, it
      was packed.:: Both times, I remember it being delicious and again, just a fun
      experience out. <br><br>The food is served family style, and overall some dishes
      wowed; I&#39;m talking to you kimchi fried rice with spam and the scallops with
      pork belly. Some were solidly good: clams and duck liver toast. And some dishes
      were passers: the cauliflower was over cooked, didn&#39;t love the crab katsu,
      although my husband loved it and by the time the entree came, I was stuffed
      and can&#39;t be a fair judgement. But overall, I enjoyed the offerings to choose
      from and I liked what we ate. <br><br>Overall, if you got through this: I really
      liked the spot. I&#39;ll come again and know to avoid cocktails and enjoy some
      delicious and interesting eats in a fun setting, if I can snag a table.'

      and with high expectations, the food did not disappoint. <br><br>Tip-If you
      haven&#39;t made a reservation, come right during opening at 5pm, you&#39;re
      likely to be sat. The line can get long, apparently this isn&#39;t some hidden
      trick of timing, it&#39;s just a matter of getting an earlier spot in the line.<br>The
      set up and ambiance of this place is gorgeous. Fresh pristine tile, a beautiful
      photo of the chef&#39;s mother blown up behind the bar, and my favorite, the
      open kitchen. They also have bomb music that ranges from classic hawaiian tracks
      to some vibey hip hop slaps. Our server, forgot her name, was real friendly
      and also made some amazing suggestions.<br><br>SHAVED PIG HEAD/EARS<br>Good
      starter to kick off dinner. The ears were crispy and paired really well with
      the nectarine. The pesto tomatillo was great. This was a suggested dish that
      really impressed me. <br><br>TUNA POKI on NORI<br>Im a sucker for poki! I know
      a lot of people complain about the portion with this, but this is just one of
      those appetizers your really gotta savor. Love the quality of the Nori and the
      fish was fresh.<br><br>SCALLOPS,MISOYAKI PORK BELLY<br>This was probably my
      favorite dish of the evening. The scallops were done right, soft in the middle,
      crisp on the out. Usually, not a big fan of peas, but it added color and a nice
      texture when combined together with the scallop and pork belly. Presentation
      points for this dish as well.<br><br>SHORT RIB,ESCARGOT, BONE MARROW<br>The
      short rib was tender and the mushrooms were super tasty.  It was super good.
      I wished the escargot and bone marrow would&#39;ve popped out more, I knew they
      were present in the dish, I just couldn&#39;t taste it as much.<br><br>BAKED
      HAWAII<br>I was stuffed after all the courses we had, but It was my girl&#39;s
      bday so we decided on dessert. We thought pineapple ice cream would be a good
      try, we usually like sorbets, mango is our go to, so this was kind of a no brainer.

      because it seemed like it could be a tourist trap. I&#39;m glad I was able to
      get a reso at 8:30pm on a Thursday on Yelp. I checked randomly a couple days
      before and low and behold, somebody must have cancelled their reservation so
      I could snap it up!<br><br>Ordered the octopus and duck liver toast. to start.
      One of the best combinations for octopus I&#39;ve had. Potatoes were super crispy
      and the octopus cooked perfectly. Olives added good flavor.<br><br>Duck liver
      toast was also very tasty and well executed. The toast was fluffy/light with
      a nice crisp char on the outside. At first I was pissed that I had to cut the
      toast myself but then I tasted it and DAMN was it good! Made me completely forget
      about the manual labor I had to do :) The pineapple paired very well with the
      duck liver in flavor and with the right amount of acidity. So simple yet so
      innovative.<br><br>Also ordered the off menu spam after debating between that
      and the spam fried rice. I figured the fried rice version would have smaller
      amounts of spam. So happy I did! Tasted way better than normal spam and loved
      the complements of the furikake and green onions on top.<br><br>For dessert
      we got the baked hawaiian which was filled with pineapple flavored ice cream.
      Was worried that the ice cream inside would be mushy by the time we got to it
      but it was very solid and not too sweet. Very refreshing and perfect way to
      end the meal.<br><br>OMG last but not least was the short rib dish. This was
      served sliced atop woody tasting wild mushrooms and next to bone marrow mixed
      with escargot and whipped potatoes. The potato soaked up fattiness and flavor
      of the marrow with the escargot adding some substance to it. The creamy texture
      went really well when spooned on top of the perfectly cooked short rib. I was
      in heaven...<br><br>It&#39;s very seldom I write rave reviews but I would actually
      give this place 6 stars if I could. The chef here is definitely a genius - all
      the dishes were very well executed and ingredient/flavor combinations were very
      unique.

    :comment: Short rib
    :body: My second time here and both visits are different experiences but both
      really GREAT!<br><br>1st visit - Came to celebrate my husband&#39;s birthday
      with our 2 kids (5 and 1 year old at the time) we were sat all the way in the
      back of the restaurant closer to the stairway in a booth, which we were so grateful
      for. Never wanna be the parents out with their kids interrupting anyone&#39;s
      date night. This particular night I had a horrible cold and was barely able
      to taste anything and was so sad, but as far as my husbands experience he LOVED
      everything. Presentation was also on point. Staff was very kind and always checking
      in if the kids needed anything. <br><br>2nd visit - came back with a total of
      10 ladies to celebrate my friends birthday at the Ohana table. The Ohana table
      was located right by the entrance by the window with bar stools. I thought it
      was a nice touch that the long table had hooks underneath for coats/purses considering
      our seats had no backs to hang anything on. We had a set menu, served family
      style at $62 a person (excluding tax and gratuity) but this consisted of 3 appetizers,
      2 salads, 3 mains, 2 desserts. We were pretty juiced to be able to sample so
      many great dishes, which I will be getting to.....<br><br>Appetizers:<br>Tuna
      poke on nori cracker - 5/5<br>This was delicious!! Typical poke on a fried tempura
      crusted seaweed. <br>Liver toast- 5/5<br>Loved this so much, I wouldn&#39;t
      mind having this as my main dish. The saltyness from the liver spread complimented
      the pineapples perfectly on the soft brioche toast. <br>Fried Oysters- 3/5<br>This
      was my least favorite and not as memorable as the other two above.<br><br>Salads:<br>Squid
      salad-5/5<br>Phenomenal!!! Definitely would order this again.<br>Watermelon
      salad 4/5<br>This was delicious as well, but I loved the squid salad just a
      tad more.<br><br>Mains:<br>Coconut clam curry- 4/5<br>This contained clams on
      the shell along with a side of freshly made naan bread. I loved the broth and
      the bread together. I couldn&#39;t stop dipping. Yum!<br>Homemade spam-4/5<br>You
      can never go wrong with spam. Tastes even better than the canned version of
      course. Meaty portions. <br>Grilled short rib 5/5<br>I love short rib, prepared
      any way. This was delicious.<br><br>Dessert- <br>Baked Hawaii -4/5<br>Love the
      presentation of this cute little bee hive and the flavors.<br>Coconut Butter
      Mochi -5/5<br>Definitely the crowd favorite! So simple and delicious. I love
      Mochi everything!!<br><br>Overall experience:<br>Great service, super busy restaurant,

      credit card number! <br><br>The day comes and I am so excited to try this place!
      I was pre-warned that it is very chill not dressy kind of spot. When my husband

      and a garage around the corner! They sat us the minute we have our name. <br><br>I
      ordered the skipper as my cocktail because they said it was their version of
      a mai tai but had amaretto in it which sounded like a cool twist! <br><br>Their
      cocktails are filled with mini ice chips which I love and it was soooo good
      and pretty strong! <br><br>With the help of yelp reviews and picking the servers
      brain about the menu... <br><br>We picked out the tuna poke- it came on crispy
      nori crackers and had this amazing burst of flavor! I highly recommend ordering.
      <br><br>Then second course was the coconut curry clams. They come with this
      freshly baked tasting naan that&#39;s buttery salty yummy tasting and perfect
      for dipping. The clams tasted like a yellow curry Thai dish but BETTER! The
      sauce is so good you just want to drink it!!!! <br><br>Our main main we ordered
      the slab of ribs and the off the menu spam because it comes with steaks of spam
      rather than small cubes! <br><br>Then we looked at the menu some more and decided
      we wanted to try the cauliflower too. The server warned us it was going to be
      a lot of food. <br><br>The spam was so delicious! Perfectly seasoned rice! Slab
      of ribs was HUGE! it&#39;s a SLAB! so tasty ... I only ate one. That big. Sweet
      but spicy but not too spicy! <br><br>The cauliflower had bone marrow hollandaise
      sauce on it.... oh ... my.... gawd so gooooood! Buttery melt in your mouth kind
      of flavor. Rich but not too rich<br><br>Sad to say no room for anything else!
      <br><br>For such a busy wanted place to eat... their food and price were awesome....

      likely to be sat. The line can get long, apparently this isn&#39;t some hidden
      trick of timing, it&#39;s just a matter of getting an earlier spot in the line.<br>The
      set up and ambiance of this place is gorgeous. Fresh pristine tile, a beautiful
      photo of the chef&#39;s mother blown up behind the bar, and my favorite, the
      open kitchen. They also have bomb music that ranges from classic hawaiian tracks
      to some vibey hip hop slaps. Our server, forgot her name, was real friendly
      and also made some amazing suggestions.<br><br>SHAVED PIG HEAD/EARS<br>Good
      starter to kick off dinner. The ears were crispy and paired really well with
      the nectarine. The pesto tomatillo was great. This was a suggested dish that
      really impressed me. <br><br>TUNA POKI on NORI<br>Im a sucker for poki! I know
      a lot of people complain about the portion with this, but this is just one of
      those appetizers your really gotta savor. Love the quality of the Nori and the
      fish was fresh.<br><br>SCALLOPS,MISOYAKI PORK BELLY<br>This was probably my
      favorite dish of the evening. The scallops were done right, soft in the middle,
      crisp on the out. Usually, not a big fan of peas, but it added color and a nice
      texture when combined together with the scallop and pork belly. Presentation
      points for this dish as well.<br><br>SHORT RIB,ESCARGOT, BONE MARROW<br>The
      short rib was tender and the mushrooms were super tasty.  It was super good.
      I wished the escargot and bone marrow would&#39;ve popped out more, I knew they
      were present in the dish, I just couldn&#39;t taste it as much.<br><br>BAKED
      HAWAII<br>I was stuffed after all the courses we had, but It was my girl&#39;s
      bday so we decided on dessert. We thought pineapple ice cream would be a good
      try, we usually like sorbets, mango is our go to, so this was kind of a no brainer.

      points for this dish as well.<br><br>SHORT RIB,ESCARGOT, BONE MARROW<br>The
      short rib was tender and the mushrooms were super tasty.  It was super good.
      I wished the escargot and bone marrow would&#39;ve popped out more, I knew they
      were present in the dish, I just couldn&#39;t taste it as much.<br><br>BAKED
      HAWAII<br>I was stuffed after all the courses we had, but It was my girl&#39;s
      bday so we decided on dessert. We thought pineapple ice cream would be a good
      try, we usually like sorbets, mango is our go to, so this was kind of a no brainer.
      The ice cream was really good, caramel was lil over powering for me in terms
      of sweetness. <br><br>Gotta come again and try more items on the menu!

    :body: For all the hype and the wait for reservations, it didn&#39;t live up to
      our expectations. Don&#39;t get me wrong the food was good but it wasn&#39;t
      exceptional. It just didn&#39;t leave that &#34;omg!&#34; sensation that we
      were expecting. We had 4 plates between the two of us and we asked 3 different
      wait staff what their favorites/recommendations were. All 3 said the ahi tuna
      and the octopus so we ordered both. We also ordered the Manila clams in curry
      sauce and the kim chi fried rice. The food had a different flare to it but again
      ehhh...<br>The customer service was excellent and for that we were pleased.
      Place is casual which is cool.

      One of the best combinations for octopus I&#39;ve had. Potatoes were super crispy
      and the octopus cooked perfectly. Olives added good flavor.<br><br>Duck liver
      toast was also very tasty and well executed. The toast was fluffy/light with
      a nice crisp char on the outside. At first I was pissed that I had to cut the
      toast myself but then I tasted it and DAMN was it good! Made me completely forget
      about the manual labor I had to do :) The pineapple paired very well with the
      duck liver in flavor and with the right amount of acidity. So simple yet so
      innovative.<br><br>Also ordered the off menu spam after debating between that
      and the spam fried rice. I figured the fried rice version would have smaller
      amounts of spam. So happy I did! Tasted way better than normal spam and loved
      the complements of the furikake and green onions on top.<br><br>For dessert
      we got the baked hawaiian which was filled with pineapple flavored ice cream.

      but it was very solid and not too sweet. Very refreshing and perfect way to
      end the meal.<br><br>OMG last but not least was the short rib dish. This was
      served sliced atop woody tasting wild mushrooms and next to bone marrow mixed
      with escargot and whipped potatoes. The potato soaked up fattiness and flavor
      of the marrow with the escargot adding some substance to it. The creamy texture
      went really well when spooned on top of the perfectly cooked short rib. I was
      in heaven...<br><br>It&#39;s very seldom I write rave reviews but I would actually
      give this place 6 stars if I could. The chef here is definitely a genius - all

  - :body: Omg!  Arrived at Marufuku Ramen @ 11:15 and the line was very long. The
      restaurant  opens at 11:30. Crazy!  They opened promptly at 11:30. I wasn&#39;t
      able to get a table on the first sitting. I put my name on the waiting list.
      Marufuku uses the Yelp waitlist system. It is very efficient.  Using the cell
      phone, Yelp waitlist system will update your waiting time and notify you when
      you are next in line. Very efficient!!!!  <br><br>The restaurant is very cute
      and small. The decor is very modern with beautiful wood panels and simple decorations.
      The staff works very fast with a smile. <br><br>I ordered the HAKATA TONKOTSU
      ($13.5) - Hakata Style Ramen with Rich Pork Broth<br>Chashu pork (simmered pork
      belly), seasoned soft boiled egg, green onions, kikurage mushrooms, and bean
      sprouts.  It was delicious. The noodles were fresh and chewy. The boiled egg
      was cooked perfectly. The vegetables were crunchy. It was a great combination
      of ingredients. The Tonkotsu soup was smooth and flavorful. You have a choice
      of different levels of spiciness. Yum!  This bowl of ramen was one of the best
      I ever have. I also ordered unsweetened iced matcha tea. Wow!  The tea was very
      good.

      octopus balls<br>The takoyaki was flavorful. It was creamy and chewy. The octopus
      was a decent size compared to the balls and overall it wasn&#39;t overly saturated

      fried squid legs<br>I liked the squid legs because it was sweet, but also salty.
      I would&#39;ve preferred the batter to be drier and more crisp because the texture

      pork, seasoned soft boiled egg, green onions, kikurage mushrooms, bean sprouts,
      and sweet corn<br>This bowl was so flavorful. It was light, but packed with
      flavor. I like that it&#39;s not overly salty and the fresh ingredients really
      shine and add to the overall flavor of the broth. The pork was tender and cooked
      perfectly. It wasn&#39;t heavily meaty. The pork broth was so good and savory.
      The bowl wasn&#39;t covered in a thin layer of oil so that&#39;s always a plus.
      I would order this again!<br><br>I really like the dishes and ramen. I&#39;ll

      Three great slices of tender, fatty meat. The soft-boiled egg was also the best
      I&#39;ve ever had. Cooked to perfection. The yolk was that wonderful &#34;runny-yet-solid&#34;
      consistency.<br><br>Their noodles are the thin type of ramen noodles. I know
      that some people prefer thick, curlyish noodles, but these thin noodles are
      actually my favorite. I like that they have a bit of a &#34;crunch&#34; to them,

      wonder the line to eat here is always long but it&#39;s totally worth it although
      I barely waited at all. Take advantage of putting your name on the waitlist
      through the Yelp app because you&#39;ll save so much time. I was driving up
      from Palo Alto and when I was at least 7 miles from the location, I put my name
      on the list. By the time I found parking on the street and walked upstairs,
      they just called my name; perfect timing. <br><br>Food:<br><br>I ordered their
      chicken karaage as a starter and their Hakata Tonkotsu DX. The karaage was nice
      and crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside. The bites weren&#39;t small
      little chicken bits but big enough to enjoy in your mouth. Now in terms of their
      ramen, I ordered it with medium spice and it was just the right amount of kick
      to the flavor. The meat inside the ramen was unexpectedly thick. It&#39;s unlike
      some other ramen spots I&#39;ve visited in LA where the pork slices are as thin
      as a cracker. The broth is seriously flavorful and tastes just like the ramen

      got to try the chicken paitan deluxe (only 15 served a day). The ramen is super
      rich, and comes with the chicken on a sizzling platter. Had to take home leftovers
      because I was stuffed! <br>Because it&#39;s so busy here, you want to get in

      Deluxe(DX) and the fried chicken.<br><br>I&#39;m not the biggest fan of the
      style of pork belly they have here. The flavor is good and they give a good
      sized portion of it, but the texture was a bit tougher than what I&#39;m used
      to for ramen. The corn was an interesting addition and added a sweetness in
      every bite. I didn&#39;t like the pickled ginger, but if you&#39;re into that,
      it&#39;s a good break from the taste. Noodles are on the thinner side. The broth
      is not too rich and not overly heavy. It was a good ramen, but I didn&#39;t
      find it too memorable.<br><br>I don&#39;t think the fried chicken is worth it
      here. I prefer a crunchier outer layer and these didn&#39;t have that. <br><br>This
      is a better alternative to waiting in line at places like Mensho due to the

      you have your mind set on eating here, you&#39;ll need to prepare yourself for
      a wait as you can easily expect to wait an hour to be seated. The wait was well
      worth it in my opinion, because the ramen was delicious. I ordered the Hakata
      Tonkotsu and my boyfriend ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu DX; the difference between
      the two items is that the DX is priced four dollars higher and has buta kakuni,
      corn, and nori. Neither of us thought the additional items were worth the extra
      cost though. I have to say, I&#39;m not the biggest fan of pork, but I loved
      every single bite of the chashu pork (including the fattier parts of the pork)
      slices that were in my ramen. <br><br>You choose your level of spiciness for
      the ramen: not spicy, mild, medium, spicy, or ultra spicy. Since I love spicy
      foods, I went with spicy. Turned out that was a mistake, because while I was
      still able to eat and enjoy my ramen, I easily could have gone with medium or
      even mild probably would have been fine (and I have a high tolerance for spicy
      foods). Just a warning: spicy really does mean spicy here. <br><br>This is the
      BEST ramen I&#39;ve had thus far from anywhere. Being from Sac, it&#39;s completely

      to the waitlist on Yelp versus coming and waiting around! The waitlist opens
      at exactly 5:45PM each night - a minute after it opens, the wait is almost an
      hour!<br><br>Location: Second level of a cute shopping mall with other restaurants
      and little stores. Tables are strategically placed so you will be a bit close
      next to your neighbor, but it&#39;s not too loud to hold a conversation. <br><br>Service:
      The food comes out fast!! Our appetizers were out in less than 5 minutes and
      our ramen was out 10 minutes after that. <br><br>Food: We ordered the edamame,
      chicken karaage, and Hakata Tonkotsu DXs (one for each of us). The edamame was
      as expected. The chicken was flavorful and came with a nice dipping sauce -
      very easy to share. Now, for the ramen - the broth was so rich, creamy, and
      flavorful. It was delicious! The noodles were a bit thinner than any other ramen
      I&#39;ve had - not necessarily a bad thing, but it was almost like angel hair
      pasta. The pork belly was so tender - it fell apart in my mouth! And more than
      enough (I hate when places give you one little piece of meat).'

      been well over a year and abit, still the line up is excruciatingly long if
      you get here 5.30pm or after 6pm. <br><br>I would recommend the Chicken Paitan
      DX, that comes with the (Ohhh sooo good) braised chicken leg with bean sprouts
      that&#39;s being served as a side along with the bowl of ramen. Medium spiciness
      was good enough for me.<br>The only thing that they need to work on is when
      the braised chicken leg is being brought to the table slightly too early before
      the bowl of ramen is served. Timing is essential in cooking.<br><br>The Hakata
      Tonkatsu Ramen was also delicious for those who want to try everything. It&#39;s
      a Hakata ramen. The Spicy was pretty spicy I&#39;d say. Left a lingering burning
      sensation on my lips!<br>Fast turn around time, bowls are good portion in size.

      not a place to linger and chit chat with your friends.

      You can taste the pork fat through the broth, and the ingredients are fresh.

      so many noodles. We were so full by the end of our meal! <br><br>Pro tip: I&#39;d
      recommend coming early - we came 20 min. before doors opened and there was already
      a line out the door. They use the Yelp waitlist and are located in an indoor

  - :body: 'Since replacing Sapporo-ya in the western end of the Japan Center two
      years ago, Marufuku Ramen has arguably been the most popular restaurant in all
      of Japantown, thanks to their buzzworthy variations on two version of Japanese
      Ramen- Chicken Paitan and Hakata-style Tonkotsu Ramen. Both paitan and tonkotsu
      are rich soups that appear cloudy-white from the cooking of pork or chicken
      bones and Hakata-style means they use thin noodles for their ramen, much thinner
      than traditional ramen served in the U.S. I have wanted to try it since they
      opened, and on a Thursday during the long summer, myself and three others decided
      to give it a go despite the huge crowds, and thankfully I was not disappointed.<br><br>I
      actually took a ride share from the other end of the city and while I was in
      the car, I signed up for reservations for four people via the Yelp app. It was
      a drawn out process due to the fact that Marufuku opens for dinner at 5:30 p.m.
      and they seat everyone who reserved a spot via the app right away and they they
      re-open the app for another round of reservations. I considered signing up for
      that session, but thought I might get there too early so I decided to wait.
      For a while, it looked like the app was closed, as it said there was a private
      party, which sounded odd since the restaurant and app were just open for reservations.
      After waiting a few more minutes, the reservations reopened and I could claim
      a spot: 42nd in line with reservations for 7 p.m. As 7 p.m. approached, we stood
      outside the restaurant, beautifully wooden paneled and fulled remodeled from
      their previous tenant. The restaurant messages you saying that there is no need
      to check-in as they will call you, but that is a misnomer, you do in fact need
      to check-in with the host once you are close to your reservation time, so they
      can mark you as present on their iPad.<br><br>After waiting for an additional
      15 minutes after our reservation time, our table for four was ready to go. The
      menu at Marufuku is simple, which makes ordering very fast and simple, which
      not only benefits you but the restaurant as well, so they can turn over tables
      faster. There are two sizes of the Chicken Paitan Ramen and two sizes of the
      Tonkatsu Ramen. The larger Chicken Paitan known as DX, is claimed to have only
      15 servings for the day, we were surprised when our server told us that they
      still had four more servings left at 7:30 p.m. So we thought, how often would
      we get the chance to order the soy-braised chicken leg on the side? So we were
      in for two orders and an additional Chicken Paitan and Hakata Tonkatsu DX, and
      to start our meal we ordered the appetizers Chicken Karaage and Takoyaki.<br><br>All
      of our food arrived at once, first the appetizers, then the chicken legs, and
      then our bowls of noodles. This forced us to not only make room on our table,
      but to be strategic about how to proceed in a sequence that would prevent our
      noodles from overcooking in the boiling broth. I noshed on one karage and one
      takoyaki ball, and then headed towards slurping on my bowl of delicious broth
      and noodles. The good news is neither of the broths at Marufuku are super heavy,
      in fact they are quite lovely and not too overly starched. The paitan didn&#39;t
      taste too strongly of that chicken and overall they&#39;re both solid balanced
      soups, rich but not fatty, salty and only slightly seaweed-y thank to the handful
      of pieces in our soup.<br><br>The noodles are the real star at Marufuku, as
      they are thin, chewy and slurpable, very reminiscent of wonton noodles in your
      local Chinese noodle shop. Neither of the bowls is overly stuffed with toppings-
      each has one soft-boiled egg, nori, bean sprouts, sliced kombu, scallions and
      corn kernels. The tonkotsu is ornamented with not only thin slices of pork belly,
       but an additional slab of pork, while the paitan comes with a few sweet, chewy
      slices of tenderly cooked chicken breast (hence their own &#34;chicken chashu&#34;).
      Our chicken leg, which I ate at the end of our meal, sits atop a bed of steaming
      and quickly wilting but still crunchy bean sprouts, but also mind you comes
      with zero indication of how you&#39;re meant to eat it with your ramen. (Hint:
      there is no real way to eat it correctly besides digging in.) The appetizers
      were decent but not super-remarkable, but we would have enjoyed them more if
      we could have savored them, had we had the time to before everything came out
      at once, which led our table to believe everything was pre-made and ready to
      serve and not freshly made, as should be expected.<br><br>Nonetheless I&#39;m
      grateful for Marufuku, even though our food came out fast, we were never rushed
      even as the restaurant continued to have high amount of turnover. It has convinced
      me to have a reason to actually eat in Japantown and it gives me hope for the
      possibility of future well-regarded businesses moving into the Japan Center.
      I plan on returning to Marufuku in the future with fellow diners who expect
      a delicious ramen dinner expecting large crowds and high quality dishes.'

      little chicken bits but big enough to enjoy in your mouth. Now in terms of their
      ramen, I ordered it with medium spice and it was just the right amount of kick
      to the flavor. The meat inside the ramen was unexpectedly thick. It&#39;s unlike
      some other ramen spots I&#39;ve visited in LA where the pork slices are as thin
      as a cracker. The broth is seriously flavorful and tastes just like the ramen

      cold, but I let our waitress know and she brought us a new plate. We also split
      a mild Hakata Tonkotsu, which was the perfect level of spiciness in my opinion.
      You can taste the pork fat through the broth, and the ingredients are fresh.
      And don&#39;t be fooled... the bowl looks small initially, but it comes with
      so many noodles. We were so full by the end of our meal! <br><br>Pro tip: I&#39;d
      recommend coming early - we came 20 min. before doors opened and there was already
      a line out the door. They use the Yelp waitlist and are located in an indoor

      been tastier. And especially for San Francisco, this was quite the affordable
      dinner at $24 after tip.<br><br>If I could do it all over again, I would have
      arrived at 4:30 and probably cut my wait time down a bit, but I didn&#39;t have
      much going on and didn&#39;t mind just walking around the Japan Center while

      bones and Hakata-style means they use thin noodles for their ramen, much thinner
      than traditional ramen served in the U.S. I have wanted to try it since they
      opened, and on a Thursday during the long summer, myself and three others decided
      to give it a go despite the huge crowds, and thankfully I was not disappointed.<br><br>I
      actually took a ride share from the other end of the city and while I was in
      the car, I signed up for reservations for four people via the Yelp app. It was
      a drawn out process due to the fact that Marufuku opens for dinner at 5:30 p.m.
      and they seat everyone who reserved a spot via the app right away and they they
      re-open the app for another round of reservations. I considered signing up for
      that session, but thought I might get there too early so I decided to wait.
      For a while, it looked like the app was closed, as it said there was a private
      party, which sounded odd since the restaurant and app were just open for reservations.
      After waiting a few more minutes, the reservations reopened and I could claim
      a spot: 42nd in line with reservations for 7 p.m. As 7 p.m. approached, we stood
      outside the restaurant, beautifully wooden paneled and fulled remodeled from
      their previous tenant. The restaurant messages you saying that there is no need
      to check-in as they will call you, but that is a misnomer, you do in fact need
      to check-in with the host once you are close to your reservation time, so they
      can mark you as present on their iPad.<br><br>After waiting for an additional
      15 minutes after our reservation time, our table for four was ready to go. The
      menu at Marufuku is simple, which makes ordering very fast and simple, which
      not only benefits you but the restaurant as well, so they can turn over tables
      faster. There are two sizes of the Chicken Paitan Ramen and two sizes of the
      Tonkatsu Ramen. The larger Chicken Paitan known as DX, is claimed to have only
      15 servings for the day, we were surprised when our server told us that they
      still had four more servings left at 7:30 p.m. So we thought, how often would
      we get the chance to order the soy-braised chicken leg on the side? So we were
      in for two orders and an additional Chicken Paitan and Hakata Tonkatsu DX, and
      to start our meal we ordered the appetizers Chicken Karaage and Takoyaki.<br><br>All
      of our food arrived at once, first the appetizers, then the chicken legs, and
      then our bowls of noodles. This forced us to not only make room on our table,
      but to be strategic about how to proceed in a sequence that would prevent our
      noodles from overcooking in the boiling broth. I noshed on one karage and one
      takoyaki ball, and then headed towards slurping on my bowl of delicious broth
      and noodles. The good news is neither of the broths at Marufuku are super heavy,
      in fact they are quite lovely and not too overly starched. The paitan didn&#39;t
      taste too strongly of that chicken and overall they&#39;re both solid balanced
      soups, rich but not fatty, salty and only slightly seaweed-y thank to the handful
      of pieces in our soup.<br><br>The noodles are the real star at Marufuku, as
      they are thin, chewy and slurpable, very reminiscent of wonton noodles in your
      local Chinese noodle shop. Neither of the bowls is overly stuffed with toppings-
      each has one soft-boiled egg, nori, bean sprouts, sliced kombu, scallions and
      corn kernels. The tonkotsu is ornamented with not only thin slices of pork belly,
       but an additional slab of pork, while the paitan comes with a few sweet, chewy
      slices of tenderly cooked chicken breast (hence their own &#34;chicken chashu&#34;).
      Our chicken leg, which I ate at the end of our meal, sits atop a bed of steaming
      and quickly wilting but still crunchy bean sprouts, but also mind you comes
      with zero indication of how you&#39;re meant to eat it with your ramen. (Hint:
      there is no real way to eat it correctly besides digging in.) The appetizers
      were decent but not super-remarkable, but we would have enjoyed them more if
      we could have savored them, had we had the time to before everything came out
      at once, which led our table to believe everything was pre-made and ready to
      serve and not freshly made, as should be expected.<br><br>Nonetheless I&#39;m
      grateful for Marufuku, even though our food came out fast, we were never rushed
      even as the restaurant continued to have high amount of turnover. It has convinced
      me to have a reason to actually eat in Japantown and it gives me hope for the
      possibility of future well-regarded businesses moving into the Japan Center.
      I plan on returning to Marufuku in the future with fellow diners who expect
      a delicious ramen dinner expecting large crowds and high quality dishes.'

      with the standard: Cafe Du Monde&#39;s.  Besides the obvious, being Brenda&#39;s
      is not absolutely encased in sugar, I remember Du Monde&#39;s being stretchier,
      a bit chewier, and airier (check out my pics for the place, including one where
      we stretch one apart--quite impressive.)  But that&#39;s not to say Brenda&#39;s
      is bad.  Oh no!... it&#39;s delicious!  Moist, slightly denser, and with a great
      savory and slightly crisp crust.  Definitely technically great.  9/10<br><br>3b.
      Chocolate &#34;filled with molten Ghirardelli chocolate&#34;:  So, the rest
      of the beignets we had follow the same formula: the same dough and cooking,
      same flesh and crisp finish, except the dough only serves to surround the filling,
      which takes up 80%ish of the total volume.  In this case, sure enough, that&#39;s
      some really insanely INTENSE bloody chocolate!  DAMN.  Dark, supremely concentrated...
      thick, cause thick is the way we all like it, most of the times... alright,
      I gotta say, that thick and dark ain&#39;t my thing, but maybe it&#39;s yours...
       9/10<br><br>3c. Granny Smith Apple &#34;sweetened with cinnamon-honey butter&#34;:
       This was the only variation I didn&#39;t like.  Despite what their description
      implies, this thing is barely sweet.  Don&#39;t expect anything like your mom&#39;s
      apple pie here with oozing goodness.  It just ain&#39;t that.  5/10<br><br>3d.
      Crawfish &#34;spiced with cayenne, scallions &amp; cheddar&#34;:  GENIUS.  Fried
      dough.  Creamy seafood.  Cheese.  Did I say FRIED?  Yup.  Lucky there ain&#39;t
      no Brenda&#39;s in San Jose cause I&#39;d just eat these everyday, ...and die.
       10/10<br><br>4. Shrimp &amp; Grits $17 &#34;sauteed shrimp, cheddar grits,
      spicy tomato-bacon gravy&#34;:  Ah, and so finally a quintessential &#39;Nawlins
      dish!--and I think the chef is most in her element with this one.  Starting
      with the grits, they&#39;re almost kinda soupy.  this ain&#39;t no Roscoe&#39;s
      grits.  And it probably ain&#39;t like most grits you&#39;ve had--only naturally
      creamy, with all the flavor coming from that red sauce.  And that red sauce--it&#39;s
      remarkably NOT oily!  Like you almost cannot see any grease whatsoever.  It&#39;s
      almost inevitable there&#39;s a film of orange oil (we&#39;re not eating Szechuan
      are we???), but Brenda&#39;s is remarkably CLEAN.  And interesting thing though,
      the sauce is sweet. I dunno how I feel about that, but anyway... it&#39;s different
      and not offensive in that way.<br><br>So, you look at that dish and go... wtf...
      I see like... 2, maybe 3 shrimps poking through?  Well, after I start diving
      in, I tell you, the shrimp is ENDLESS!  Personally I think the plating is just
      too understated in how all the shrimp is hidden underneath... all that PERFECTLY
      cooked shrimp.  Not dry, not stringy, still a bit translucent and crunchy.  Yummy!<br><br>This
      has got to be the least greasy, most wholesome shrimp and grits I&#39;ve ever
      had, yet somehow it&#39;s still rich as f.  A gastronomic miracle.  10/10<br><br>5.
      Chicken, Sausage &amp; Okra Gumbo (Cup) $6:  And like the shrimp &amp; grits,
      that wholesome-homesome shows through here too.  The &#34;soup&#34; is slightly
      less thick than what you&#39;ll find elsewhere, and the seasoning is definitely
      far more tame, yet everything seems just right and balanced.  The chicken is
      in big chunks, and NOT DRY.  Everything&#39;s just so CLEAN..... almost refreshingly
      simple and light!  For a gumbo!!!  10/10<br><br>I cannot wait to come back,
      but definitely for dinner!<br><br>5/5<br><br>#soulfood #southernfood #southerncuisine

  - :body: You can&#39;t go wrong with ordering anything off the menu. Everything
      is pretty good. The wait times are long though. For a Saturday lunch time was
      about 30-40 mins. Sign in on the huge chalkboard inside to the right. <br><br>The
      eggs benedict were really tasty. Poached eggs were nice and gooey on top of
      melt in your mouth biscuits the fried chicken was seasoned super well but coulda
      been crispier. Beignets were bomb too. <br><br>Service was a bit rushed in beginning
      but smoothed out. I was disappointed that they only serve brunch and not the
      lunch menu. <br><br>Parking, good luck. Street parking.

  - :body: Yum!! Came to San Fran for my friend&#39;s bachelorette party and Brenda&#39;s
      was our first stop after we landed on a Thursday morning. There was no wait!
      But, they don&#39;t sit incomplete parties. <br><br>Service - was super great!
      We placed our orders and within 5-10 minutes, our food was being served! <br><br>Food
      - Our group tried the crawfish beignets, eggs Benedict with fried chicken, banana
      foster French toast, and the shrimp and grits. Everything was pretty delicious!
      The filling and spices of the crawfish beignets really made the dish. The fried
      chicken for the eggs Benedict was crispy yet moist, perfection! Only regret
      from our meal was not asking for the syrup on the French toast to be on the
      side. This was the last dish we tried during our meal, and unfortunately the
      toast was a little soggy from all the syrup. <br><br>Overall, I&#39;d definitely
      recommend Brenda&#39;s for any foodies out there! You won&#39;t be disappointed.

  - :body: 5 stars for the food and service. It is so popular, I have ignored the
      45 minutes we had to wait to get in. <br><br>First time for brunch. And it did
      not disappoint. Two of us could&#39;ve share one dish but we each ordered an
      entree and we shared the beignet flight of crawfish, apple, chocolate and plain.
      <br><br>The beignets were big. And tasty. And yummy with the 1/4 inch of powdered
      sugar packed onto each one. The crawfish was a perfect savory beignet with crawfish
      pieces in a seafood sauce. The apple beignet had nice slices of juicy apples.
      The chocolate was to die for. And the plain one was a perfect beignet to start
      with. (We ate them in reverse order of this list.)<br><br>I ordered the pork
      belly with the cheese grits. Omg. The pork belly was firm but tender. One end
      was a bit crispy (yes!! Texture!) and it was sitting in the bed of cheesy yummy
      grits and a soft egg next to it. I was only able to eat half of it after the
      beignets. <br><br>My cousin had the Benedict with fried chicken patty and loved
      it. A huge portion as well with two biscuit benedicts. <br><br>My tummy is chubby
      but happy this weekend.

      someone&#39;s pics or review of this place.  Why did it take me so goddam long
      to come???... I got no excuse.  But, hey, I did, and I tell you, the hype is
      real, and absolutely deserved!<br><br>Yeah, I&#39;ve been to &#39;Nawlins (a
      few times even) and got fatter.  Definitely fatter.  So the food&#39;s good
      and all, but Brenda&#39;s makes the stuff so much easier to eat for those that
      don&#39;t wanna get diabetes or die of a heart attack, or before being able

      Community Coffee with Chicory $3:  K, so I&#39;ve only had coffee with chicory
      maybe at most a couple times in my life, so I dunno if I&#39;m qualified to
      judge this one, but all I can say it has a very interesting taste with powerful
      flavors at first, though not bitter.  But give it a few seconds, cause the finish
      is bitter as f.  Quite the experience.  8/10?<br><br>2. Grandma&#39;s Molasses-Black
      Walnut Iced Coffee $5 &#34;with whipped cream&#34;:  And like the hot coffee,
      definitely interesting.  It&#39;s certainly sweet, as you&#39;d expect, but
      there some good complexity going on in there.  There&#39;s of course a very
      small hint of walnut, but the molasses adds the sweetness that balances with
      the slightly acidic fruity flavors.  I liked it.  8/10<br><br>3. Beignet Flight

      Plain &#34;for the die-hard traditionalist&#34;:  Alright, so we gotta compare
      with the standard: Cafe Du Monde&#39;s.  Besides the obvious, being Brenda&#39;s
      is not absolutely encased in sugar, I remember Du Monde&#39;s being stretchier,
      a bit chewier, and airier (check out my pics for the place, including one where
      we stretch one apart--quite impressive.)  But that&#39;s not to say Brenda&#39;s

      with the standard: Cafe Du Monde&#39;s.  Besides the obvious, being Brenda&#39;s
      is not absolutely encased in sugar, I remember Du Monde&#39;s being stretchier,
      a bit chewier, and airier (check out my pics for the place, including one where
      we stretch one apart--quite impressive.)  But that&#39;s not to say Brenda&#39;s
      is bad.  Oh no!... it&#39;s delicious!  Moist, slightly denser, and with a great
      savory and slightly crisp crust.  Definitely technically great.  9/10<br><br>3b.
      Chocolate &#34;filled with molten Ghirardelli chocolate&#34;:  So, the rest
      of the beignets we had follow the same formula: the same dough and cooking,
      same flesh and crisp finish, except the dough only serves to surround the filling,
      which takes up 80%ish of the total volume.  In this case, sure enough, that&#39;s
      some really insanely INTENSE bloody chocolate!  DAMN.  Dark, supremely concentrated...
      thick, cause thick is the way we all like it, most of the times... alright,
      I gotta say, that thick and dark ain&#39;t my thing, but maybe it&#39;s yours...
       9/10<br><br>3c. Granny Smith Apple &#34;sweetened with cinnamon-honey butter&#34;:
       This was the only variation I didn&#39;t like.  Despite what their description
      implies, this thing is barely sweet.  Don&#39;t expect anything like your mom&#39;s
      apple pie here with oozing goodness.  It just ain&#39;t that.  5/10<br><br>3d.
      Crawfish &#34;spiced with cayenne, scallions &amp; cheddar&#34;:  GENIUS.  Fried
      dough.  Creamy seafood.  Cheese.  Did I say FRIED?  Yup.  Lucky there ain&#39;t
      no Brenda&#39;s in San Jose cause I&#39;d just eat these everyday, ...and die.
       10/10<br><br>4. Shrimp &amp; Grits $17 &#34;sauteed shrimp, cheddar grits,
      spicy tomato-bacon gravy&#34;:  Ah, and so finally a quintessential &#39;Nawlins
      dish!--and I think the chef is most in her element with this one.  Starting
      with the grits, they&#39;re almost kinda soupy.  this ain&#39;t no Roscoe&#39;s
      grits.  And it probably ain&#39;t like most grits you&#39;ve had--only naturally
      creamy, with all the flavor coming from that red sauce.  And that red sauce--it&#39;s
      remarkably NOT oily!  Like you almost cannot see any grease whatsoever.  It&#39;s
      almost inevitable there&#39;s a film of orange oil (we&#39;re not eating Szechuan
      are we???), but Brenda&#39;s is remarkably CLEAN.  And interesting thing though,
      the sauce is sweet. I dunno how I feel about that, but anyway... it&#39;s different
      and not offensive in that way.<br><br>So, you look at that dish and go... wtf...
      I see like... 2, maybe 3 shrimps poking through?  Well, after I start diving
      in, I tell you, the shrimp is ENDLESS!  Personally I think the plating is just
      too understated in how all the shrimp is hidden underneath... all that PERFECTLY
      cooked shrimp.  Not dry, not stringy, still a bit translucent and crunchy.  Yummy!<br><br>This
      has got to be the least greasy, most wholesome shrimp and grits I&#39;ve ever
      had, yet somehow it&#39;s still rich as f.  A gastronomic miracle.  10/10<br><br>5.
      Chicken, Sausage &amp; Okra Gumbo (Cup) $6:  And like the shrimp &amp; grits,
      that wholesome-homesome shows through here too.  The &#34;soup&#34; is slightly
      less thick than what you&#39;ll find elsewhere, and the seasoning is definitely
      far more tame, yet everything seems just right and balanced.  The chicken is
      in big chunks, and NOT DRY.  Everything&#39;s just so CLEAN..... almost refreshingly
      simple and light!  For a gumbo!!!  10/10<br><br>I cannot wait to come back,

      don&#39;t wanna get diabetes or die of a heart attack, or before being able

      maybe at most a couple times in my life, so I dunno if I&#39;m qualified to
      judge this one, but all I can say it has a very interesting taste with powerful

      is pretty good. The wait times are long though. For a Saturday lunch time was
      about 30-40 mins. Sign in on the huge chalkboard inside to the right. <br><br>The
      eggs benedict were really tasty. Poached eggs were nice and gooey on top of
      melt in your mouth biscuits the fried chicken was seasoned super well but coulda
      been crispier. Beignets were bomb too. <br><br>Service was a bit rushed in beginning
      but smoothed out. I was disappointed that they only serve brunch and not the

      from our meal was not asking for the syrup on the French toast to be on the

  - :body: "~~~ SIZZLE ~~~<br><br>This restaurant is HOT HOT HOT.  Can&#39;t get enough
      of your Thai food.  Farmhouse Kitchen Thai deserves a five star rating based
      on food alone. Prices are fair, portions are decent, and food is good.  My favorites
      include Volcano Beef with noodles (SECRET menu), beware it&#39;s SPICY HOT!
       It comes with a whole short rib with the bone, FYI dog mamas and papas out
      there.  Another favorite of mine is the Fried Chicken dinner, so crispy on the
      outside and tender on the inside. I could eat the batter alone!  This dish also
      comes with yellow curry, blue rice, and naan!  The curry is GOOD!  Lastly for
      desert, try the mango sticky rice and you won&#39;t be disappointed. The coconut
      dressing has the perfect touch of sweetness. The mango is beautifully decorated
      and is fresh, not too ripe.  I particularly liked that they did not use white
      rice as their sticky rice base, made it more unique. I loved the lovely orchid
      on top. What a great touch!  <br><br>Will definitely return for more delicious
      goodness!!"

  - :body: Just okay for me. Was really excited to try this restaurant given all the
      hype. I&#39;m a huge fan of northern Thai cuisine (particularly food from Chiang
      Mai and Pai) but wanted to give this place a chance anyway, as there aren&#39;t
      that many Thai options in SF. <br><br>My benchmark for most Thai places is how
      good their pad thai is. It&#39;s not what I would choose to eat every time,
      but I often get it the first time I go to a Thai restaurant just to see what
      their take is on a basic dish such as this. So, we got the pad thai, red curry,
      and chicken larb. Pad thai was just ok. Tasted too tomatoey/ketchupy for my
      liking. I couldn&#39;t taste the oyster sauce and fish sauce that I&#39;ve grown
      accustomed to. Red curry was much better but not really worth the price especially
      because you have to order rice for an additional cost. Portion size also not
      that big. Chicken larb did not stand out for me either. The dish is labelled
      as spicy but I didn&#39;t find it to be overwhelmingly so. The chicken pieces
      were not cut consistently, some huge pieces, some small pieces. Again, could
      have used some more &#34;Thainess&#34; in my opinion i.e. flavor was lacking.
      <br><br>Service is fine. Takes a while to place orders, get water refilled,
      etc. but that&#39;s because the restaurant is so busy. I&#39;d go again for
      the fun vibes and atmosphere and maybe try something else on their menu? Also,
      make a reservation or you&#39;ll be waiting an hour+ on the weekends.

  - :body: Whether it&#39;s the food, the space, or the service, Farmhouse has 5 stars
      across the board. The place is perfect for groups, but I highly recommend making
      reservations. <br><br>The Hat Yai Fried Chicken itself could be the perfect
      dish for an individual. It has, of course, fried chicken, a small bowl of curry,
      and a side of roti. The chicken is fried perfectly and the curry had great taste
      as well. And who can say no to roti?<br><br>My favorite dish that we tried was
      surprisingly the Crab Fried Rice. It is a simple dish, but the fresh crab meat
      and the light, fluffy fried rice had me going for 2nd and 3rd servings. The
      sauces that came with this dish were also perfect. They did not skimp on the
      crab meat either. <br><br>Farmhouse Kitchen is definitely a new favorite for
      me in SF. I&#39;d definitely come back again!

  - :body: I came expecting overpriced, Westernized Thai food. Ermmm, I don&#39;t
      know if my opinion is much different after visiting. The food is good, thought
      not mind boggling. Here are factoids of my visit:<br><br>First, zee food!<br>-
      We ordered the Tom yum soup, pad sew ye, and red Thai curry. My favorite was
      the red curry. Yum! Pad sew ye was also good. Tom yum soup was... okay la. Their
      rice is blue. It&#39;s the food coloring; it&#39;s tastes like white jasmine
      rice. <br><br>Other details <br>- Wait time can be long during peak hours. They
      take a certain amount of reservations each day. Grab a number and get drinks
      nearby. <br>- A lot of people come here for celebrations, during which the staff
      will dance, play music, and sing around that table. Get it. <br>- Environment
      is loud and noisy. Colorful place with lots of decorations. <br><br>My favorite
      Thai place in SF is still House of Thai in the TL. It&#39;s nice to try new
      places though, and I&#39;m glad I came here.

      of the best Thai food I&#39;ve ever had, including the food I had when I was
      actually in Thailand. <br><br>Yes the menu is pricey, even by San Francisco
      standards. However, I do think that most dishes on the menu is worth it. I highly
      recommend spending a bit more money and ordering one of the &#34;special&#34;
      items. My friend ordered Pad See You and it wasn&#39;t nearly as impressive
      as some of the pricier options.<br><br>I ordered the 24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup
      and the Hat Yai Fried Chicken. They&#39;re individually very filling so I ended
      up sharing with my boyfriend. We both agree that these two items are amazingly
      delicious. The Beef Noodle Soup comes with a huge chunk of super tender beef
      short rib and savory bone marrow broth. The Hat Yai fried chicken was perfectly
      fried and the yellow curry that came with it was so flavorful.<br><br>The service
      is great as well. My group was celebrating a birthday and if you order a dessert
      you get a special birthday song! All the servers gather and make it really festive
      with instruments as they march throughout the restaurant, kind of like a mini

      about this place for a while now so last weekend we went here for my friend&#39;s
      birthday. There were 10 of us but we split into two different tables. My table
      ordered the following to share. <br><br>- Papaya Salad <br>- Green Curry (Beef)
      <br>- Panang Ribs <br>- Hat Yai Fried Chicken <br>- Chef Special - chicken soup,
      chicken larb and some super yummy pork belly + Thai crack sauce <br>- Thai Vacation
      (Dessert)<br>- Coconut Granita (Dessert)<br><br>Everything was good but the
      dish that stood out the most that I can&#39;t wait to come to eat again was
      the hati yai fried chicken, so yummy with that curry sauce! My second favorite
      was the panang ribs! The portions are generous so I would recommend doing family
      style so your party can try a little bit of everything. For the dessert, I love
      the coconut granita, it was just coconut shaved iced served in the young coconut
      with coconut meat. So refreshing! <br><br>We were here for my friend&#39;s birthday
      so ALL the staff on the floor sang him happy birthday which I thought was sweet.
      The song lasted for a good 2 minutes which is a lot of singing. Overall, great
      experience and I can&#39;t wait to come back!

      been my new favorite go to Thai restaurant! <br><br>I liked this place from
      the moment I stepped inside. It&#39;s a strange feeling because it&#39;s almost
      Thai, but kind of Hawaiian and has some random decorations like a wall full
      of faucets. The men wear bright red lipstick and wear colorful flowery clothing.
      It&#39;s kind of funny and brings a smile to your face. <br><br>I loved the
      food!! I loved the Tom Kha and I&#39;m super duper picky when it comes to my
      coconut milk soup with the right amount of lime. I really liked it! The crab
      rice was sooooo yummy too!!! I really wouldn&#39;t mind going back to get more
      of that! The papaya salad too was perfect! I mean I only have positives to say.
      Wait, I take it back, the pad see ew was not my favorite and was missing a lot
      of noodles in my opinion. I probably won&#39;t order that dish again. The appetizers
      were yummy and I really liked the fish cakes. It was different because the cucumber
      was on whole pieces. <br><br>Overall, I just liked it, and I will definitely
      go back when craving some Thai food. <br><br>I know a lot of people complained
      about price and serving size, but you are paying for the experience and the
      quality of food. I personally thought it was okay. <br><br>I&#39;ll be back,

      food that&#39;s trying to be sophisticated by arranging it creatively on a plate.
      But bad food with sophisticated plate setting is still just that - bad food!<br><br>The
      &#34;secret&#34; menu item - volcano noodle - is entirely too sweet and spicy.
      I think the extreme spice is there to mask the mediocre flavor of the noodles.
      The meat that came in this dish was good though. The vegetables at the bottom
      of the cup is just sad looking (and tasting). <br><br>We also ordered the herbal
      rice salad. For me, I feel like this is a bad imitation of the Burmese tea leaf
      salad. This dish is way too sweet. And why is the rice blue?<br><br>The tom
      yum soup lacks flavor and tartness. <br><br>The only good item I sampled was

      my favorite restaurants in general in SF too!! <br><br>The difference between
      farmhouse thai and another thai restaurant is the quality of meat they use.
      All of the meat prepared in the dishes are all so tender, fresh, not chewy and
      you can really taste the quality in the food. I&#39;m so sick of dry chicken
      and chewy beef. Here the beef if WAGYU. That is quality shit. Ok now on to the
      dishes.<br><br>Where do I start? The food is prepared with such authethic flavors
      and it really does taste like Thai food from Thailand. I&#39;ve tried so much
      on the menu here, pad thai (the shrimp in it is REAL good, not your typical
      thai meat, 24 hr noodle soup, red curry, green curry, panang curry and probably
      more. <br><br>My favorites dishes here are the yellow curry (it&#39;s like crack
      with the roti bread they give you too and the Khao Soi (unfortunately it is
      a special, so I call ahead if I really want it. And if they don&#39;t have it,
      I get pretty sad) <br><br>Also amazing place to come in groups as well! Don&#39;t

      for their chef as &#34;new rising star&#34; or something online, which turned
      out to be a &#34;rice salad&#34;- literally the same rice that comes with their
      entrees with some garnishes surrounding it. C&#39;mon guys, if you&#39;re trying
      to garner some votes, you could at least be a bit more appreciative of your
      customers here...<br><br>I got the short rib curry, which was good though not
      incredible. They give you a sizeable beef rib, roughly on par with what you&#39;d
      get at a barbecue place for roughly the same price (~$30) and it was tender
      and moist. The curry on top added some kick, though was a tad salty. Honestly,
      this is probably one of the better values on the menu as even the stir-fried
      noodle dishes sit in at around $15+ for a pretty small portion.<br><br>I&#39;m

      tried to get in on a Wednesday night and they were booked! Came back first thing
      in the morning on 4th of July and got lucky! The atmosphere is a little different
      compared to their Oakland location. The seating is more &#34;community&#34;
      style so it is a little tight. The food was displayed very well and full of
      flavor. They had a lot of your traditional Thai food but with a little twist.
      We ordered the Meing Kam, Pad Thai with Prawn, and the Kai Yang with papaya
      salad. My favorite was the Meing kam! And the rest was delicious as well but
      it wouldn&#39;t be something I would come back for. I also end up ordering the
      pork belly larb to go and that was a hit. I would def come back if I&#39;m the

    :comment: Chef&#39;s special
    :body: Ok, the hype is real! This place is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! My gfs has been raving
      about this place for a while now so last weekend we went here for my friend&#39;s
      birthday. There were 10 of us but we split into two different tables. My table
      ordered the following to share. <br><br>- Papaya Salad <br>- Green Curry (Beef)
      <br>- Panang Ribs <br>- Hat Yai Fried Chicken <br>- Chef Special - chicken soup,
      chicken larb and some super yummy pork belly + Thai crack sauce <br>- Thai Vacation
      (Dessert)<br>- Coconut Granita (Dessert)<br><br>Everything was good but the
      dish that stood out the most that I can&#39;t wait to come to eat again was
      the hati yai fried chicken, so yummy with that curry sauce! My second favorite
      was the panang ribs! The portions are generous so I would recommend doing family
      style so your party can try a little bit of everything. For the dessert, I love
      the coconut granita, it was just coconut shaved iced served in the young coconut
      with coconut meat. So refreshing! <br><br>We were here for my friend&#39;s birthday
      so ALL the staff on the floor sang him happy birthday which I thought was sweet.
      The song lasted for a good 2 minutes which is a lot of singing. Overall, great
      experience and I can&#39;t wait to come back!

    :body: Omgoodness!!!! Oh why are you so far away from my house?? You could have
      been my new favorite go to Thai restaurant! <br><br>I liked this place from
      the moment I stepped inside. It&#39;s a strange feeling because it&#39;s almost
      Thai, but kind of Hawaiian and has some random decorations like a wall full
      of faucets. The men wear bright red lipstick and wear colorful flowery clothing.
      It&#39;s kind of funny and brings a smile to your face. <br><br>I loved the
      food!! I loved the Tom Kha and I&#39;m super duper picky when it comes to my
      coconut milk soup with the right amount of lime. I really liked it! The crab
      rice was sooooo yummy too!!! I really wouldn&#39;t mind going back to get more
      of that! The papaya salad too was perfect! I mean I only have positives to say.
      Wait, I take it back, the pad see ew was not my favorite and was missing a lot
      of noodles in my opinion. I probably won&#39;t order that dish again. The appetizers
      were yummy and I really liked the fish cakes. It was different because the cucumber
      was on whole pieces. <br><br>Overall, I just liked it, and I will definitely
      go back when craving some Thai food. <br><br>I know a lot of people complained
      about price and serving size, but you are paying for the experience and the
      quality of food. I personally thought it was okay. <br><br>I&#39;ll be back,

    :comment: Yellow Curry Dinner
    :body: This is my absolute favorite Thai restaurant in SF and probably one of
      my favorite restaurants in general in SF too!! <br><br>The difference between
      farmhouse thai and another thai restaurant is the quality of meat they use.
      All of the meat prepared in the dishes are all so tender, fresh, not chewy and
      you can really taste the quality in the food. I&#39;m so sick of dry chicken
      and chewy beef. Here the beef if WAGYU. That is quality shit. Ok now on to the
      dishes.<br><br>Where do I start? The food is prepared with such authethic flavors
      and it really does taste like Thai food from Thailand. I&#39;ve tried so much
      on the menu here, pad thai (the shrimp in it is REAL good, not your typical
      thai meat, 24 hr noodle soup, red curry, green curry, panang curry and probably
      more. <br><br>My favorites dishes here are the yellow curry (it&#39;s like crack
      with the roti bread they give you too and the Khao Soi (unfortunately it is
      a special, so I call ahead if I really want it. And if they don&#39;t have it,
      I get pretty sad) <br><br>Also amazing place to come in groups as well! Don&#39;t
      forget to make reservations on the weekends otherwise there will definitely
      be a long wait.

    :body: This place is pricey for what you get.<br><br>Dig the vibe. It&#39;s very
      eclectic with bright colors and a tropical feel. People were friendly, which
      is always a plus. <br><br>Onto the food. We got a free appetizer for voting
      for their chef as &#34;new rising star&#34; or something online, which turned
      out to be a &#34;rice salad&#34;- literally the same rice that comes with their
      entrees with some garnishes surrounding it. C&#39;mon guys, if you&#39;re trying
      to garner some votes, you could at least be a bit more appreciative of your
      customers here...<br><br>I got the short rib curry, which was good though not
      incredible. They give you a sizeable beef rib, roughly on par with what you&#39;d
      get at a barbecue place for roughly the same price (~$30) and it was tender
      and moist. The curry on top added some kick, though was a tad salty. Honestly,
      this is probably one of the better values on the menu as even the stir-fried
      noodle dishes sit in at around $15+ for a pretty small portion.<br><br>I&#39;m
      not universally opposed to paying more, but at this price point, I expect more,
      either in terms of quality or quantity.

      tried to get in on a Wednesday night and they were booked! Came back first thing
      in the morning on 4th of July and got lucky! The atmosphere is a little different
      compared to their Oakland location. The seating is more &#34;community&#34;
      style so it is a little tight. The food was displayed very well and full of
      flavor. They had a lot of your traditional Thai food but with a little twist.
      We ordered the Meing Kam, Pad Thai with Prawn, and the Kai Yang with papaya
      salad. My favorite was the Meing kam! And the rest was delicious as well but
      it wouldn&#39;t be something I would come back for. I also end up ordering the
      pork belly larb to go and that was a hit. I would def come back if I&#39;m the

      were holding for larger party&#34;..  I was then placed at another table with
      seating for two. I wasn&#39;t happy, but settled down to eat my meal and call
      it a night. Fast-forward an hour later...I&#39;m almost finished eating and
      another couple comes inside.  The Black lady in the couple asked for the same
      area I  had requested earlier.  Now since there were two in that party, I assumed
      they would be seated where she requested. NO, they were told it was being held
      for other reservations.  WTF!!!!! There were three empty tables, in that section
      ....the whole time I was there..<br>No one came in for that table.  The section
      wasn&#39;t closed because there was one group that was seated in section...when
      I arrived &amp; when I left.  <br><br>This type of discrimination is ridiculous!!

      I ordered the mushroom quiche and was pleasantly surprised. There were nice
      good pieces of mushrooms in it, so you can actually bite into the quiche and
      know there&#39;s mushrooms. The salad it came with on the side was light dressed

  - :body: Preface this by saying that I was a tourist in SF and my friends were searching
      for a casual but still chic place to eat in the mission district. Most places
      were packed to capacity Friday night, but we managed to get a table at Fable.
      Very lucky!<br><br>We ordered wine.....a few bottles :), service was very good,
      and the overall ambience is classy. The outside seating was even nicer.<br><br>I
      had the vegan lasagna even though I&#39;m not vegan. It was delicious. Most
      of my friends got burgers, that seemed to be the most popular. My other friend
      got the chicken dish.<br><br>Overall, recommend. If you&#39;re in the mission
      district, this place won&#39;t steer you wrong. I can see this place having
      a wait usually though.

    :body: If you&#39;re looking for good food in a cute spot with the most comfy
      chairs ever. This your spot! They have all your usual brunch options AND sangria,
      but they did run out of coffee around 1 pm... how do you run out of coffee?
      I ordered the mushroom quiche and was pleasantly surprised. There were nice
      good pieces of mushrooms in it, so you can actually bite into the quiche and
      know there&#39;s mushrooms. The salad it came with on the side was light dressed
      with a vinaigrette. Their banana bread is delicious. I highly recommend it if
      you&#39;re with a small group to share. <br><br>There&#39;s also a back patio
      area, unfortunately the wait for it was too long so we sat inside which was
      just fine with us. If you can, make reservations in advance. It&#39;ll probably
      save you a lot of time :)

    :comment: morning bowl (farro, basil pistachio pesto, sweet potato, baby squash,
      pickled onion, cherry tomato, arugula salad) with extra bacon
    :body: A decent choice for brunch and lunch, albeit with super long lines if you
      don&#39;t get here first thing in the morning on weekends. <br><br>I like how
      the breakfast fare is a step up from the usual eggs and potatoes that anyone
      could easy drum up in their own kitchens. The morning bowl, for example, was
      a delicious, nicely portioned array of farro, sweet potatoes, squash, cherry
      tomatoes, pickled onion, arugula, cashew crema, and tomatillo salsa. It all
      felt nourishing and good for you, but of course I had to muck it up in a delightful
      way and add bacon. Score!<br><br>On a separate weekend morning visit, the bartender
      was kind enough to ask the kitchen if I could get something off the lunch menu
      even though it didn&#39;t technically begin until 11am. The fried chicken sandwich
      was nicely fried and came in a decent portion alongside a side salad. A salty
      dog cocktail was a refreshingly tart, sour way to complement the fried chicken
      and start what was already a warm day.<br><br>As mentioned, lines can get insane

  - :body: I had high expectations of noosh because from pictures the food and atmosphere
      looks amazing. I would&#39;ve given it 5 starts but our service wasn&#39;t the
      best as others have mentioned. I came in around 9pm on a Friday and for a party
      of 2 we probably waited just 5-10 minutes but there continued to be a line most
      of the time we were there so on popular nights it doesn&#39;t really die down.<br><br>We
      started off each ordering a drink. I ordered the Paloma and they brought me
      the wrong drink at first, and then even after I corrected them and they went
      back to correct it they brought me the wrong one again which was a little odd.
      By that time we had already ordered and got our food and my friend had already
      finished her drink so that was a little annoying but it didn&#39;t affect the
      meal that much. The drink itself was good, not amazing but definitely pretty
      having a pink salt rim.<br><br>For the food, we knew we wanted to try some dips
      and one of the flatbreads. We ordered the red pepper muhammara (amazing) and
      the smoked yogurt. It came with 2 full pitas which were fluffy and delicious.
      Seriously if they sold that muhammara by the tub I would buy it. For the flatbread
      we ordered the kale and mushroom which was really good. It seemed like it had
      a tomato sauce on the bottom which I wasn&#39;t really expecting it to be like
      an actual pizza but was pleasantly surprised. I don&#39;t eat pork but if I
      did I would&#39;ve definitely ordered the pork soujuk flatbread. I think next
      time I&#39;ll order one of the other ones but add an egg!<br><br>Overall we
      had a really good experience, but knocking off a star because the service was
      okay and the food a little pricey for what you get. I&#39;ll definitely be back
      to try more of the dips though!

      couldn&#39;t sit at a table since that&#39;s &#34;reserved for parties of 4&#34;
      so we had to sit at the bar, which was even more annoying because the bartender
      was expecting/pushing us to order drinks even though I told the hostess we weren&#39;t

      break down my experience today and the reason why am giving Noosh only 2 stars<br>1-
      service- we got seated with minimum wait and that&#39;s amazing given the location
      and it&#39;s Sunday.staff ,our waitress was ok little on the stand-off esh attitude.
      Didn&#39;t ask us what we like to drink 15 minutes later I remembered that I
      wanted to try the tea but I decided not too. She brought my youngest daughter
      food first, 6 minutes later my other daughter then 15 minutes I wait and my
      dish no were to be found. She comes around to check on how we are doing and
      when I asked her where is my food she walked away then came back telling me
      it&#39;s in the oven we have many orders. Bottom line no apology at all. My
      food arrived and both of my kids were done eating! Not fun <br><br>2- food experience-
      limited options like they serve kebabs with no rice weird a bit for Mediterranean
      cuisine not even offer it as a side dish .flat bread were great my only comment
      is I specifically asked the waitress about how the egg cooked she said it won&#39;t
      be raw it kinda was, it had a lot of jelly on top even after I broke it open
      on top of the flat bread.<br><br>3- why 2 stars- we were served one dish by
      the owner- nice to see them involved out on the floor . Ambience was nice <br><br>4-
      suggestions- you make delicious pita and flat bread, add few more verity to
      your menu <br>Train your staff for better timing and customer service orientation
      <br> Last but not least cleanses of dishes and utensils since you serve a lot
      of eggs most of the dishes and forks I used and my kids smelled eggy<br><br>I

      Greece<br>-- Appetizer: Carrot salad, chubby pita and hummus<br>-- Main: Noosh&#39;s
      pick (5 assorted skewers - chicken, mushroom, pork, beef, lamb shoulder), pork
      soujuk flatbread <br><br>Going Dutch:<br>Meal + gratuity came out to about $54
      per person <br><br>How was it:<br>-- Food Quality: The wine was refreshing and
      not too sweet; it paired well with our Mediterranean flavors. We really enjoyed
      the caramelized onions and the spicy-roasted carrots in the salad. It was a
      bit bigger than we thought it&#39;d be so we had to leave some. The pita was
      light and fluffy and the hummus had a nice spice to it, but otherwise standard
      for any high-quality Mediterannean spot. If you&#39;re looking to shed items
      from your order, skip the pita and spreads (we enjoyed our other dishes more).
      The Noosh&#39;s pick is a fun way to try the skewers, but they are not all created
      equal. We strongly preferred the beef and chicken and found the other meats
      a bit too fatty and chewy. Additionally, we&#39;ve been here twice and the skewers
      have come out lukewarm each time, which is not ideal for meats. The star of
      the meal was the pork soujuk flatbread. The cheese - sausage - egg combo was
      very nice and the dough was very soft. The flatbread is very different from
      pizza (the dough almost had a sweet pastry taste and texture). <br><br>-- Ambiance:
      This is why people love this place. The decor and seating layout are reminiscent
      of the Greek isles - lots of turquoise which makes it trendy and a millennial
      haven. We liked the huge windows and outdoor seating option which is ideal on
      a hot summer night (albeit rare in SF).  <br><br>-- Service: This is not Noosh&#39;s
      forte. We&#39;ve been here twice and have complaints about both experiences
      from a service perspective. The first time we went, all of our food came out
      before our wine and had to wait and ask multiple times before it came. The second
      time, the wine came after half our meal. Due to the small-plate format, things
      tend to come out very fast/as soon as they&#39;re ready. In addition, the second
      time we experienced a rude waiter. I lost my paper napkin and was grabbing one
      from an adjacent table setting and a random waiter scolded me and told me to
      ask for a napkin next time. Seemed a little harsh when you&#39;re paying over
      $50/person at their restaurant. We hope to see this improve <br><br>Inside Scoop:<br>--If
      you arrive before 6pm on a weekday you can get seated almost immediately, but
      a line quickly accumulated at the door after 6:30pm.<br><br>Room for dessert?
      <br>--We were stuffed after our meal and even had to leave some on the table
      which we generally never do. We recommend ordering one item less than we did
      for two people or ordering in waves (starting small). <br><br>Second date? <br>--We
      might try it again but want to see the service improve before we do. Though
      this is a cute and picturesque place to take a first date, the service issues
      and variation in food tastiness, it&#39;s not on our go-to list.'

  - :body: I&#39;ll start on the positive- the space is AWESOME. Super gorgeous, very
      breathable, fresh interior decor; I LOVE their plateware with the turquoise
      marbling. The hosts have always been super friendly and helpful, bartenders
      not so much. They have outdoor seating (not right in this moment because of
      construction), and a huge window wall that can open inside. Theres a variety
      of seating options - bar, tables, stools and benches. <br><br>I was so hopeful
      that their flavors would be legit, but they really miss the mark for me; and
      I&#39;ve been twice now, three months apart.<br><br>The 1st teller - the olive
      oil. It&#39;s literally the EASIEST opportunity to get a win as a Med spot.
      Especially with all the amazing sources around us in the bay. The ferry building
      alone sports at least three vendors I can think of. Their olive oil is bland
      and forgettable and not something you want to dip your sometimes stale pita
      in. <br><br>The hummous was pretty bad. Needs more garlic, more salt, more lemon.
      So basically everything that goes in hummous. The texture was mealy and I think
      it could really benefit from a blend. Babaghanoush was ok, could&#39;ve been
      smokier.<br><br>The salad was really delicious but could have used more saffron.<br><br>The
      1st time I came just after they opened the kabobs were my favorite thing on
      the menu. The lamb literally melted in my mouth. Though I really didnt care
      for their halloumi - because it wasn&#39;t halloumi. Grilled halloumi has an
      amazing rubbery texture with a tangy and salt kick on  your palette. I actually
      asked one of their employees if it was actually tofu because thats what the
      consistency and taste was like. The pork then (and last night) was delicious,
      very tender. Chicken was pretty overdone, could benefit from a sous vide prep
      and quick sear at the end. The beef both times was so chewy and thick. But all
      of the sauces were amazing, each kabob (in Noosh&#39;s pick combo) had their
      own sauce that perfectly complemented the protein. I tried the mushroom last
      night and the sauce was like a chimichurri and did a good job of masking how
      terrible the consistency of the mushroom was. <br><br>Sadly they don&#39;t even
      carry and Mediterranean pilsner which is what I was craving the entire meal.
      <br><br>Bar service was excellent Gilberto was very helpful my first visit.
      My waiter last night was pretty irritating though he kept trying to up-sell
      us on everything way too frequently. My paloma was way too strong though, and
      it craved a slice of fresh grapefruit. I do love how they have the wood-like
      straws and not paper because we all know how frustrating a mushy straw it. <br><br>Overall,
      amazing vibe and space, tons of opportunity to improve food preparation and
      flavor in my opinion, they could really make a name for themselves.

      we left at 6:30 the line was out the door so I would recommend coming a bit
      earlier to avoid the line!<br><br>Food was pretty good! I was feeling more adventurous
      today and wanted to try things I&#39;ve never had before like the Greek Po&#39;boy.
      This is basically a pita sandwich with fried calamari on the inside. The lamb
      kebab was also good--meat was very soft and the sauce on top paired very well
      with it. My favorite was the Pork Soujuk Turkish flatbread! I love my carbs
      and I love cheese so what&#39;s not to love about this flatbread? The cheese
      has a very subtle flavor and the bread was very soft. The spices from the pork

      early. There&#39;s only about three outdoor tables but there are heat lamps.
      <br><br>For the two of us we shared the hummus, Aleppo chicken pita sandwich
      and the pork flatbread. Perfect amount of food for date night but the pork flatbread
      was so good I was wishing I didn&#39;t have to share! Hummus was also super
      tasty. Definitely will be coming back!

  - :body: I forgot how much I love this area, and Noosh is the perfect restaurant
      to be on this street! The portions are larger than you would expect and the
      prices can&#39;t be beat. Noosh doesn&#39;t take reservations, but when I came
      on a Friday at 6pm I was able to be seated right away! When we left around 7ish
      there was definitely a long line (but still worth it). You can&#39;t go wrong
      with the dips, skewers, and pork soujuk. The service was great as well :) Not
      sure if I would make a trip out here specifically for this restaurant again,
      but if I was in the area and the line was short I would definitely stop by.

    :body: Such a cute spot for a meal! In love with the interior of this restaurant.
      I came on a Friday around 5:30 and the wait was about 15 minutes. By the time
      we left at 6:30 the line was out the door so I would recommend coming a bit
      earlier to avoid the line!<br><br>Food was pretty good! I was feeling more adventurous
      today and wanted to try things I&#39;ve never had before like the Greek Po&#39;boy.
      This is basically a pita sandwich with fried calamari on the inside. The lamb
      kebab was also good--meat was very soft and the sauce on top paired very well
      with it. My favorite was the Pork Soujuk Turkish flatbread! I love my carbs
      and I love cheese so what&#39;s not to love about this flatbread? The cheese
      has a very subtle flavor and the bread was very soft. The spices from the pork
      definitely came through and the egg was just the cherry on top of this meal.

    :body: I had high expectations of noosh because from pictures the food and atmosphere
      looks amazing. I would&#39;ve given it 5 starts but our service wasn&#39;t the
      best as others have mentioned. I came in around 9pm on a Friday and for a party
      of 2 we probably waited just 5-10 minutes but there continued to be a line most
      of the time we were there so on popular nights it doesn&#39;t really die down.<br><br>We
      started off each ordering a drink. I ordered the Paloma and they brought me
      the wrong drink at first, and then even after I corrected them and they went
      back to correct it they brought me the wrong one again which was a little odd.
      By that time we had already ordered and got our food and my friend had already
      finished her drink so that was a little annoying but it didn&#39;t affect the
      meal that much. The drink itself was good, not amazing but definitely pretty
      having a pink salt rim.<br><br>For the food, we knew we wanted to try some dips
      and one of the flatbreads. We ordered the red pepper muhammara (amazing) and
      the smoked yogurt. It came with 2 full pitas which were fluffy and delicious.
      Seriously if they sold that muhammara by the tub I would buy it. For the flatbread
      we ordered the kale and mushroom which was really good. It seemed like it had
      a tomato sauce on the bottom which I wasn&#39;t really expecting it to be like
      an actual pizza but was pleasantly surprised. I don&#39;t eat pork but if I
      did I would&#39;ve definitely ordered the pork soujuk flatbread. I think next
      time I&#39;ll order one of the other ones but add an egg!<br><br>Overall we
      had a really good experience, but knocking off a star because the service was
      okay and the food a little pricey for what you get. I&#39;ll definitely be back
      to try more of the dips though!

    :comment: 
    :body: I&#39;ll start on the positive- the space is AWESOME. Super gorgeous, very
      breathable, fresh interior decor; I LOVE their plateware with the turquoise
      marbling. The hosts have always been super friendly and helpful, bartenders
      not so much. They have outdoor seating (not right in this moment because of
      construction), and a huge window wall that can open inside. Theres a variety
      of seating options - bar, tables, stools and benches. <br><br>I was so hopeful
      that their flavors would be legit, but they really miss the mark for me; and
      I&#39;ve been twice now, three months apart.<br><br>The 1st teller - the olive
      oil. It&#39;s literally the EASIEST opportunity to get a win as a Med spot.
      Especially with all the amazing sources around us in the bay. The ferry building
      alone sports at least three vendors I can think of. Their olive oil is bland
      and forgettable and not something you want to dip your sometimes stale pita
      in. <br><br>The hummous was pretty bad. Needs more garlic, more salt, more lemon.
      So basically everything that goes in hummous. The texture was mealy and I think
      it could really benefit from a blend. Babaghanoush was ok, could&#39;ve been
      smokier.<br><br>The salad was really delicious but could have used more saffron.<br><br>The
      1st time I came just after they opened the kabobs were my favorite thing on
      the menu. The lamb literally melted in my mouth. Though I really didnt care
      for their halloumi - because it wasn&#39;t halloumi. Grilled halloumi has an
      amazing rubbery texture with a tangy and salt kick on  your palette. I actually
      asked one of their employees if it was actually tofu because thats what the
      consistency and taste was like. The pork then (and last night) was delicious,
      very tender. Chicken was pretty overdone, could benefit from a sous vide prep
      and quick sear at the end. The beef both times was so chewy and thick. But all
      of the sauces were amazing, each kabob (in Noosh&#39;s pick combo) had their
      own sauce that perfectly complemented the protein. I tried the mushroom last
      night and the sauce was like a chimichurri and did a good job of masking how
      terrible the consistency of the mushroom was. <br><br>Sadly they don&#39;t even
      carry and Mediterranean pilsner which is what I was craving the entire meal.
      <br><br>Bar service was excellent Gilberto was very helpful my first visit.
      My waiter last night was pretty irritating though he kept trying to up-sell
      us on everything way too frequently. My paloma was way too strong though, and
      it craved a slice of fresh grapefruit. I do love how they have the wood-like

      amazing rubbery texture with a tangy and salt kick on  your palette. I actually
      asked one of their employees if it was actually tofu because thats what the
      consistency and taste was like. The pork then (and last night) was delicious,
      very tender. Chicken was pretty overdone, could benefit from a sous vide prep
      and quick sear at the end. The beef both times was so chewy and thick. But all
      of the sauces were amazing, each kabob (in Noosh&#39;s pick combo) had their
      own sauce that perfectly complemented the protein. I tried the mushroom last

      I came on a Friday around 5:30 and the wait was about 15 minutes. By the time
      we left at 6:30 the line was out the door so I would recommend coming a bit
      earlier to avoid the line!<br><br>Food was pretty good! I was feeling more adventurous
      today and wanted to try things I&#39;ve never had before like the Greek Po&#39;boy.
      This is basically a pita sandwich with fried calamari on the inside. The lamb
      kebab was also good--meat was very soft and the sauce on top paired very well
      with it. My favorite was the Pork Soujuk Turkish flatbread! I love my carbs
      and I love cheese so what&#39;s not to love about this flatbread? The cheese
      has a very subtle flavor and the bread was very soft. The spices from the pork
      definitely came through and the egg was just the cherry on top of this meal.

      to be on this street! The portions are larger than you would expect and the
      prices can&#39;t be beat. Noosh doesn&#39;t take reservations, but when I came
      on a Friday at 6pm I was able to be seated right away! When we left around 7ish
      there was definitely a long line (but still worth it). You can&#39;t go wrong
      with the dips, skewers, and pork soujuk. The service was great as well :) Not
      sure if I would make a trip out here specifically for this restaurant again,
      but if I was in the area and the line was short I would definitely stop by.

      tropical was the best of all three - there shrimp was fresh and big enough that

      was hoping for some sort of cream on top to tie the dish together. The grilled
      octopus was well cooked, and the sauce was great. We thought, though, that it

      helping us decide what to order, especially with volume (I hate when waitresses/waiters

      get right). <br><br>Food: The food came out fast - crazy fast for the tacos

      in less than 5 min. The grilled octopus came out 10 minutes later. The taco
      tropical was the best of all three - there shrimp was fresh and big enough that
      frying it didn&#39;t overwhelm the flavor. The tropical relish (mango, etc.)
      was also a nice touch! The chicken tinga tostadas were nice and juicy, but I
      was hoping for some sort of cream on top to tie the dish together. The grilled
      octopus was well cooked, and the sauce was great. We thought, though, that it
      should be cut down in size to be a $18-19 dish because it was a lot of octopus
      even for the two of us...with that being said, we ate it all'

      Mission, if you&#39;re not feeling El Farolito or La Taqueria (or El Tech, or...

      of color as the co-owner, and has genuinely authentic interior design and recipes.<br><br>Getting
      reservations for a Friday dinner two days out was super easy via the Yelp app.

      or the 14/49 lines on Muni.<br><br>We were seated pretty quickly and service
      here was great! Servers, not just the one directly assisting us, would keep
      checking in and making sure that we were okay.<br><br>We ordered the guacamole,
      shrimp ceviche, kale salad, chicken tinga tostadas, and carnitas (very hungry
      lol). Skip the guacamole - it&#39;s really good but you definitely want to save
      space for the amazing stuff on the menu like the ceviche for the appetizers!
      The tostadas were incredible, with suuuuper juicy meat. Pork belly and carnitas
      are also a go-to!!<br><br>I ordered the albino cowboy on recommendation of our

      it today! Came right when they opened on a Friday and such a cute brunch spot.
      They&#39;ve got all the aesthetically pleasing brunch decorations on point,
      so only hoped for the food and service to be just as good.<br><br>Our server
      Issara was so helpful! Everything on the menu sounded good so we just asked
      for recommendations on what the best things on the menu were. My bf and I opted
      for the shrimp and grits and the coconut banana pancakes. YUM YUM YUM!!! My
      first time trying grits so nothing really to compare it to, but it was really
      good! I&#39;d get this one again. Adding some hot sauce on it made it even better.
      The coconut banana pancakes were the star of the show for me. I&#39;m not a
      huge pancake fan, but this was just wow. Soo coconutty I love it! They put just
      the right amount of syrup too in my opinion but definitely ask for more syrup
      and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll accommodate! Our waters were constantly filled
      and so were our coffee. Super friendly and attentive servers that made our brunch
      worthwhile and the food also came in a timely manner and was reasonably priced.<br><br>Worth

      Sausage, and Grits. Everything about this was good but most importantly, the
      shrimp tasted somewhat fresh and was cooked to the right temperature. I hate

    :body: If you like hearty farm breakfast food this is the place for you. Since
      it is in San Francisco you will have to wait to get in but the wait is well
      worth it.<br>The food is delicious and hearty. My favorite were the crispy potatoes.
      Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. I still dream about them.<br>Everything
      we had was tasty. I will say that their banana bread was lackluster but still
      very good.<br>The place has a rustic, vintage vibe (think Little House on the
      Prairie meets chic Victorian Grandmother&#39;s house) and even the finer details
      of the dining experience were not overlooked, such as the custom balanced silverware
      and vintage dishware. I will probably be the only person commenting on the quality
      of the cutlery but I feel that it speaks to their restauranteurs dedication,
      not only to the quality food, but the ambience that the finer points of the

      good! I&#39;d get this one again. Adding some hot sauce on it made it even better.

      the right amount of syrup too in my opinion but definitely ask for more syrup

    :body: Uh, yum. Why does SF always come out with hit brunch places? <br><br>I
      got the Pistachio Latte and it was delicious. Rich coffee flavor with just the
      right amount of pistachio, without tasting fake. Then my main dish was the Shrimp,
      Sausage, and Grits. Everything about this was good but most importantly, the
      shrimp tasted somewhat fresh and was cooked to the right temperature. I hate
      chalky, chewy shrimp! <br><br>I came on a Monday morning around 10am so the
      restaurant wasn&#39;t full when I got there but got full when I left an hour
      later. Service was attentive.

      Came with a friend at about 10:40am on a Saturday, wrote our names on the list
      and was seated within 10 minutes (probably helped that a couple of the parties
      in front of us didn&#39;t have all their people present). There is actually
      a decent amount of seating though! <br><br>I got the Oyster Mushroom Scamble
      ($15.50) and it was AMAZING. The eggs were so fluffy and I loved the cauliflower
      and mushrooms (maybe could use a TAD more veggies but I&#39;m a veggie person).
      The breakfast potatoes were so crispy and flavorful! I was STUFFED from just
      this and I couldn&#39;t finish the toast that came with it. I would definitely
      get this again! <br><br>My friend got the Sausage and Shrimp Grits ($18), which
      she said was super good and super super filling. I tried one of the shrimps
      and it was pretty flavorful! <br><br>We split the Pan De Mie Custardy French
      Toast small size ($9) and it was sooo good. I wish it was a bit warm on the
      inside, but we did wait to eat it for last. It wasn&#39;t overly sweet, which
      I liked and though it was a small piece it was a perfect ending bite since we
      were already so full! <br><br>Overall, service was good and the food was delicious!

      8:30 but food wasnt served until 9:30-9:50. We shoveled down the food and some
      wine. When we asked about dessert that took another 20 minutes.<br><br>All in
      all the dinner food was fairly forgettable. Brunch is bomb tho. Its truly a
      1 star to 5 star experience depending on what timeyou go

      for dinner and it was okay because the rissoto I had was overcooked and very
      mushy. Amazing how an okay experience can keep you away from the restaurant
      for a long time.<br><br>My recent dining was for brunch and it was delicious.
      I had guests in town and they wanted to done here. I had their burger Ned rare

      a few dishes here and there will leave your perplexed, and often merely because

      that day, and you know what?--they NAILED dinner.  F.  Might be one of the top
      3 best dinners I&#39;ve had in the last year or so, at any price.<br><br>Alright,
      enough talk... read my last review for the chit chat, let&#39;s get into it...<br><br>1.
      The Raven $13 &#34;rittenhouse rye, punt e mes, ornage liqueur&#34;:  It&#39;s
      impressive in that it&#39;s so completely rye whisky flavor in the way that
      a standard martini is vodka (or gin I suppose), but yet..... not.  So, if you&#39;re
      looking for pure whisky flavor but smoother, this is it.  Served plain, no ice,
      no embellishments, no nothing--pure.  8/10<br><br>2. Peach Salad $15 &#34;sweet
      corn, pecans and arugula&#34;:  One of 2 disappointing dishes, but again, only
      because all the other &#34;friends&#34; are hotter!  It&#39;s a well made salad
      with good ingredients, but it was just outshone... 7/10<br><br>3. Smoked Brisket
      $17 &#34;pickled kohlrabi, potato salad and horseradish creme fraiche&#34;:
       It ain&#39;t your backyard BBQ.  Hell, it ain&#39;t even good &#39;ol any BBQ
      I&#39;ve had.  It&#39;s fancy sht BBQ.  Smokier than hell.  Super moist.  Packed
      with flavor.  Plated for rich fancy schmancy people.  9/10<br><br>4. Grilled
      Lamb Riblets $17 &#34;harissa, lime and mint&#34;:  HOLY MUTHA.... yeah, so
      the smoked brisket ain&#39;t your grand dad&#39;s oil drum smoked creation,
      and these ribs ain&#39;t.......... EARTHLY.  Wtf.  The flavors ain&#39;t no
      American BBQ that&#39;s for sure... oily spicy goodness surrounds tender and
      beautifully smoked meaty ribs.  MUST TRY.  These lambs probably are the happiest
      dead lambs cause their death could not be better celebrated.  10/10<br><br>5.
      Wood Grilled Burger with Bacon and Gruyere Cheese $23 &#34;pickled onions and
      french fries&#34;:  Yeah so, pretty much like the burger I got last time.  Read
      up the last review.  Oh, and the waiter will ask, &#34;Is medium-rare okay with
      you?&#34;  F YES.  Answer anything else and we ain&#39;t friends.  10/10<br><br>6.
      Country Pork Chop $35 &#34;green beans, plums, purslane and hazelnuts&#34;:
       Simply put, the best cooked pork chop I&#39;ve had in 2 decades.  TWO DECADES.
       I am not sure which is &#34;better tasting&#34; between Jack Sprat&#39;s Tomahawk
      Pork Chop and Nopa&#39;s, but either way, orgasm is imminent.  Oh yeah, and
      again, being me I ask, &#34;Make sure this isn&#39;t dry okay?&#34;  Waiter
      says, &#34;We cook this medium rare, is that okay?  It&#39;s very high quality
      meat so you don&#39;t have to worry.&#34;  And sure enough, medium rare perfectly
      cooked ultra-tender juicy-as-f pig.  10/10<br><br>7. Pappardelle $25 &#34;nine
      hour bolognese, zucchini, spinach and parmesan&#34;:  Only dish we&#39;ve had
      here that is &#34;traditional.&#34;  Made absolutely perfectly of course, al
      dente handmade noodles and all.  9/10<br><br>8. Flatbread $20 &#34;bacon, zucchini,
      cherry tomatoes, mozzarella and mustard greens&#34;:  And here&#39;s the other
      disappointment.  Yes, it&#39;s perfect.  But kinda boring compared to everything
      else.  7/10<br><br>9. Purple Spiritual Synesthesia $13 &#34;macchu pisco, creme
      de biolette, maraska, lemon&#34;:  They have a whole section in their menu on
      &#34;spiritual synesthesia.&#34;  I don&#39;t get it.  Whatever.  Owner so rich
      he can afford the really good sht I guess.  Too high.  4/10<br><br>10. Orange
      Spiritual Synesthesia $14 &#34;hampden jamaican rum, orange liquer, orange,
      lemon&#34;:  Better than the Purple, with more complexity.  6/10<br><br>11.
      Islay Campfire $12 &#34;ardbeg 10, st. george coffee liqueur, espresso&#34;:
       Alas, 1 for 4?  This one reminded me of the time I attempted to make ice cream
      with Laphroaig.  Well.... don&#39;t do it.  Trust me.  But one thing for sure--down
      this, and your head will explode.  2/10<br><br>12. Salted Honey Tart $11 &#34;pickled
      strawberries, peach and tarragon creme fraiche&#34;:  It&#39;s served kinda
      warm, and sure enough, its buttery, maybe bordering oily.  But I dig it.  Personally
      I thought when it cooled down it tasted better, but my 2 dining-mates thought
      I was nuts.  Good cream tart.  8/10<br><br>13. Dark Chocolate Torte $11 &#34;espresso
      meringue, blackberries and stout ice cream&#34;:  I very rarely get chocolate
      tortes cause they&#39;re always DRY DRY DRY.  Let me tell you, this was some
      kind of black magic cause it was mind-blowingly delicious.  Not dry, packed
      with textures, and crap tons of dark chocolate taste.  Almost bitter there was
      so much.  10/10<br><br>Nopa never fails to amaze.  I guess if you&#39;re looking
      for boring food don&#39;t come?  Yeah that&#39;s how I&#39;ll end this: Nopa
      is not boring...<br><br>........ ha ha who am I kidding... Nopa is BRILLIANT.<br><br>5/5<br><br>#sanfrancisco

      and reputation. So 4 stars. <br><br>Ambiance is A1 - the large windows w/ alcohol
      displays, hanging plants, wood fans yes yes yes. <br><br>We got 2 entrees, 3
      appetizers and a dessert for 3 ppl. No one was stuffed no one was hungry so
      this was good. <br><br>Goat cheese w/ crostini. - don&#39;t waste your time.
      The goat cheese was warmed, no other flavor the raspberry and strawberry toppings
      weren&#39;t infused into the cheese as expected. The crostini was also pointless,
      no flavor, a mere plate for the warm goat cheese.<br><br>Smoked trout - This
      was done well the fish was tender, oiled to perfection. Pickled onions were
      very good they&#39;re should have been more. <br><br>Beef tongue soup - order
      this! <br>similar to borscht, the sour cream topping was a nice add. I prefer
      the tongue pieces smaller because I don&#39;t like the texture but that was
      fine they were so succulent and broke part <br><br>Chicken was the winner, we
      ordered just to order a staple, &#34;chicken is always good let&#39;s just order
      that.&#34; But it was surprisingly well flavored, intense yet simple. the eggplant
      side was sour but perplexing side dish. Something I&#39;m always looking for<br><br>Salmon
      also had a lot to offer, the actual meat and skin was good but it was the cream
      corn base with yellow beans and dill that brought the pizzaz and true unique
      flavor. <br><br>Cardamom fritters - I LOVE cardamom, I add it to my tea nearly
      every time, but...these cardamom fritters were a disappointment. Truly they
      were just donut holes with a light sugar cardamom topping. I expected the bread
      to have more cardamom, chai, cinnamon flavor. The frozen yogurt pairing was
      very nice though

      custard french toast was amazing as always. You have to order this dish! It&#39;s
      my favorite dish here.<br><br>The other two things we ordered were meh. The
      bacon with pork and beans was so salty. The sausage was just a bougie hot dog.
       Nothing special.<br><br>I love the use of the wood oven, but the main dishes
      fell so flat. The restaurant is situated on a corner and gets a lot of light
      which I love. I won&#39;t be back for brunch soon, but I do want to try their
      dinner menu. They accept reservations for brunch so make sure to make one before
      you come or you will have to wait an hour for a walk-in!

       Alas, 1 for 4?  This one reminded me of the time I attempted to make ice cream

      damn hard (well, also hard to get reservations too, ha ha).  In fact, I think
      this would be my favorite &#34;nouveau American&#34; restaurant in SF.  Sure,
      a few dishes here and there will leave your perplexed, and often merely because
      everything served before and after would be so amazingly spectacular!  It&#39;s

      for brunch (see previous review) and were damn impressed.  Had some best-evers
      that day, and you know what?--they NAILED dinner.  F.  Might be one of the top
      3 best dinners I&#39;ve had in the last year or so, at any price.<br><br>Alright,
      enough talk... read my last review for the chit chat, let&#39;s get into it...<br><br>1.
      The Raven $13 &#34;rittenhouse rye, punt e mes, ornage liqueur&#34;:  It&#39;s
      impressive in that it&#39;s so completely rye whisky flavor in the way that
      a standard martini is vodka (or gin I suppose), but yet..... not.  So, if you&#39;re
      looking for pure whisky flavor but smoother, this is it.  Served plain, no ice,
      no embellishments, no nothing--pure.  8/10<br><br>2. Peach Salad $15 &#34;sweet
      corn, pecans and arugula&#34;:  One of 2 disappointing dishes, but again, only
      because all the other &#34;friends&#34; are hotter!  It&#39;s a well made salad
      with good ingredients, but it was just outshone... 7/10<br><br>3. Smoked Brisket
      $17 &#34;pickled kohlrabi, potato salad and horseradish creme fraiche&#34;:
       It ain&#39;t your backyard BBQ.  Hell, it ain&#39;t even good &#39;ol any BBQ
      I&#39;ve had.  It&#39;s fancy sht BBQ.  Smokier than hell.  Super moist.  Packed
      with flavor.  Plated for rich fancy schmancy people.  9/10<br><br>4. Grilled
      Lamb Riblets $17 &#34;harissa, lime and mint&#34;:  HOLY MUTHA.... yeah, so
      the smoked brisket ain&#39;t your grand dad&#39;s oil drum smoked creation,
      and these ribs ain&#39;t.......... EARTHLY.  Wtf.  The flavors ain&#39;t no
      American BBQ that&#39;s for sure... oily spicy goodness surrounds tender and
      beautifully smoked meaty ribs.  MUST TRY.  These lambs probably are the happiest
      dead lambs cause their death could not be better celebrated.  10/10<br><br>5.
      Wood Grilled Burger with Bacon and Gruyere Cheese $23 &#34;pickled onions and
      french fries&#34;:  Yeah so, pretty much like the burger I got last time.  Read
      up the last review.  Oh, and the waiter will ask, &#34;Is medium-rare okay with
      you?&#34;  F YES.  Answer anything else and we ain&#39;t friends.  10/10<br><br>6.
      Country Pork Chop $35 &#34;green beans, plums, purslane and hazelnuts&#34;:
       Simply put, the best cooked pork chop I&#39;ve had in 2 decades.  TWO DECADES.
       I am not sure which is &#34;better tasting&#34; between Jack Sprat&#39;s Tomahawk
      Pork Chop and Nopa&#39;s, but either way, orgasm is imminent.  Oh yeah, and
      again, being me I ask, &#34;Make sure this isn&#39;t dry okay?&#34;  Waiter
      says, &#34;We cook this medium rare, is that okay?  It&#39;s very high quality
      meat so you don&#39;t have to worry.&#34;  And sure enough, medium rare perfectly
      cooked ultra-tender juicy-as-f pig.  10/10<br><br>7. Pappardelle $25 &#34;nine
      hour bolognese, zucchini, spinach and parmesan&#34;:  Only dish we&#39;ve had
      here that is &#34;traditional.&#34;  Made absolutely perfectly of course, al
      dente handmade noodles and all.  9/10<br><br>8. Flatbread $20 &#34;bacon, zucchini,
      cherry tomatoes, mozzarella and mustard greens&#34;:  And here&#39;s the other
      disappointment.  Yes, it&#39;s perfect.  But kinda boring compared to everything
      else.  7/10<br><br>9. Purple Spiritual Synesthesia $13 &#34;macchu pisco, creme
      de biolette, maraska, lemon&#34;:  They have a whole section in their menu on
      &#34;spiritual synesthesia.&#34;  I don&#39;t get it.  Whatever.  Owner so rich
      he can afford the really good sht I guess.  Too high.  4/10<br><br>10. Orange
      Spiritual Synesthesia $14 &#34;hampden jamaican rum, orange liquer, orange,
      lemon&#34;:  Better than the Purple, with more complexity.  6/10<br><br>11.
      Islay Campfire $12 &#34;ardbeg 10, st. george coffee liqueur, espresso&#34;:
       Alas, 1 for 4?  This one reminded me of the time I attempted to make ice cream

      corn, pecans and arugula&#34;:  One of 2 disappointing dishes, but again, only
      because all the other &#34;friends&#34; are hotter!  It&#39;s a well made salad
      with good ingredients, but it was just outshone... 7/10<br><br>3. Smoked Brisket
      $17 &#34;pickled kohlrabi, potato salad and horseradish creme fraiche&#34;:
       It ain&#39;t your backyard BBQ.  Hell, it ain&#39;t even good &#39;ol any BBQ
      I&#39;ve had.  It&#39;s fancy sht BBQ.  Smokier than hell.  Super moist.  Packed
      with flavor.  Plated for rich fancy schmancy people.  9/10<br><br>4. Grilled
      Lamb Riblets $17 &#34;harissa, lime and mint&#34;:  HOLY MUTHA.... yeah, so
      the smoked brisket ain&#39;t your grand dad&#39;s oil drum smoked creation,
      and these ribs ain&#39;t.......... EARTHLY.  Wtf.  The flavors ain&#39;t no
      American BBQ that&#39;s for sure... oily spicy goodness surrounds tender and
      beautifully smoked meaty ribs.  MUST TRY.  These lambs probably are the happiest
      dead lambs cause their death could not be better celebrated.  10/10<br><br>5.
      Wood Grilled Burger with Bacon and Gruyere Cheese $23 &#34;pickled onions and
      french fries&#34;:  Yeah so, pretty much like the burger I got last time.  Read
      up the last review.  Oh, and the waiter will ask, &#34;Is medium-rare okay with
      you?&#34;  F YES.  Answer anything else and we ain&#39;t friends.  10/10<br><br>6.
      Country Pork Chop $35 &#34;green beans, plums, purslane and hazelnuts&#34;:
       Simply put, the best cooked pork chop I&#39;ve had in 2 decades.  TWO DECADES.
       I am not sure which is &#34;better tasting&#34; between Jack Sprat&#39;s Tomahawk
      Pork Chop and Nopa&#39;s, but either way, orgasm is imminent.  Oh yeah, and
      again, being me I ask, &#34;Make sure this isn&#39;t dry okay?&#34;  Waiter
      says, &#34;We cook this medium rare, is that okay?  It&#39;s very high quality
      meat so you don&#39;t have to worry.&#34;  And sure enough, medium rare perfectly
      cooked ultra-tender juicy-as-f pig.  10/10<br><br>7. Pappardelle $25 &#34;nine
      hour bolognese, zucchini, spinach and parmesan&#34;:  Only dish we&#39;ve had
      here that is &#34;traditional.&#34;  Made absolutely perfectly of course, al
      dente handmade noodles and all.  9/10<br><br>8. Flatbread $20 &#34;bacon, zucchini,
      cherry tomatoes, mozzarella and mustard greens&#34;:  And here&#39;s the other
      disappointment.  Yes, it&#39;s perfect.  But kinda boring compared to everything
      else.  7/10<br><br>9. Purple Spiritual Synesthesia $13 &#34;macchu pisco, creme
      de biolette, maraska, lemon&#34;:  They have a whole section in their menu on
      &#34;spiritual synesthesia.&#34;  I don&#39;t get it.  Whatever.  Owner so rich
      he can afford the really good sht I guess.  Too high.  4/10<br><br>10. Orange
      Spiritual Synesthesia $14 &#34;hampden jamaican rum, orange liquer, orange,
      lemon&#34;:  Better than the Purple, with more complexity.  6/10<br><br>11.
      Islay Campfire $12 &#34;ardbeg 10, st. george coffee liqueur, espresso&#34;:
       Alas, 1 for 4?  This one reminded me of the time I attempted to make ice cream
      with Laphroaig.  Well.... don&#39;t do it.  Trust me.  But one thing for sure--down
      this, and your head will explode.  2/10<br><br>12. Salted Honey Tart $11 &#34;pickled
      strawberries, peach and tarragon creme fraiche&#34;:  It&#39;s served kinda
      warm, and sure enough, its buttery, maybe bordering oily.  But I dig it.  Personally
      I thought when it cooled down it tasted better, but my 2 dining-mates thought
      I was nuts.  Good cream tart.  8/10<br><br>13. Dark Chocolate Torte $11 &#34;espresso
      meringue, blackberries and stout ice cream&#34;:  I very rarely get chocolate
      tortes cause they&#39;re always DRY DRY DRY.  Let me tell you, this was some
      kind of black magic cause it was mind-blowingly delicious.  Not dry, packed
      with textures, and crap tons of dark chocolate taste.  Almost bitter there was
      so much.  10/10<br><br>Nopa never fails to amaze.  I guess if you&#39;re looking
      for boring food don&#39;t come?  Yeah that&#39;s how I&#39;ll end this: Nopa
      is not boring...<br><br>........ ha ha who am I kidding... Nopa is BRILLIANT.<br><br>5/5<br><br>#sanfrancisco

      it moves pretty quickly. The restaurant is super cute and clean! I had the French
      toast. So yummy. As an entree we had the breakfast pizza and the Millionaire
      Bacon sandwich. The deep fried French toast is wonderful. Tastes like funnel
      cake but better. It&#39;s got a very crispy edge and it&#39;s just lovely. The
      syrup is warm and delicious! <br><br>The standard American breakfast stuff is
      on the menu but produced in really good quantities with outstanding bacon and
      hash browns. <br><br>Great food &amp; ambience. Good waiting staff who were
      quite happy to explain the menu options. Make sure you arrive to Sweet Maple
      with large appetite&#39;s because they do not serve small portions!

      so if you&#39;ve been to those locations, this one isn&#39;t much different.
      <br><br>My friend was visiting during winter and wanted to try food here so
      we went for brunch. Waited in the cold wind for 30 mins. water is served at
      the front if anyone in the line gets thirsty. <br><br>But they can do better
      if they have a waitlist, not letting people wait outside in the wind or rain?
      Dont understand the marketing purpose of some restaurants by taking away the
      waiting list and let people just stand in line to show that they are Popular,
      and just let people waste time in the line. Caught cold afterwards. <br><br>Regarding
      the food, except the bacon, the other dishes aren&#39;t outstanding. We ordered
      bacon flight, for 2 people, that&#39;s too oily and too much. We were only able
      to try two and boxed the rest. Not worth the wait. Don&#39;t understand the
      hype and why some people wait for an hour. Will never come here again.

      The wait staff at all of the Millionaire&#39;s Bacon restaurants are always
      swift in serving you which is both appreciated and impressive. <br><br>Unfortunately
      I think the food here is overpriced for what it is. I ordered the Marnier French
      Toast 3/5 which barely tasted of citrus and ended up being an expensive French
      toast that looked pretty. I was also disappointed that it was $3 extra for a
      tiny handful of fruit topping. We also ordered the turkey panini which was okay
      3/5, but the sweet potato tater tots were a nice touch. <br><br>Im willing to
      come back and try other menu options because like I said, this place is a beautiful
      brunch spot and they had a big menu selection, but I personally prefer Kitchen
      Story.

  - :body: This place has officially ruined all other brunch places for me... or specifically
      bacon! On my trip up to SF we were looking for a good brunch place to try and
      a friend recommended this place! Like other places in SF parking is terrible
      but after a couple of rounds you should be able to find parking on the street.
      The line wasn&#39;t too long around 12pm but boy was it packed! They have an
      option of patio or inside but if you choose inside just know it&#39;s a bit
      cramped!<br><br>The one thing I recommend to try for sure if their Millionaire&#39;s
      Bacon! It is probably by far the juiciest and most flavorful bacon I&#39;ve
      ever eaten in my life. One bite and I was hooked, I basically devoured the bacon
      before I even touched my dish! I decided to order the Wild Benedict and Friends
      (mushroom medley with meyer lemon hollandaise). I honestly don&#39;t like runny
      yolks but by god did this change my mind about eggs benedict! The mushrooms
      were juicy and just complimented the dish very well. The hollandaise was just
      on point. I basically ate every last bite there was on the plate. Their portions
      are also huge! I didn&#39;t expect there to be a lot of potatoes but I wasn&#39;t
      complaining since it was good. <br><br>As mentioned the ONLY downside to the
      place is how cramped it can get. I felt like I barely had any room and the tables
      were a bit close to each other. Another thing was you kinda have to shout a
      bit to hear what the other person is saying since it was KINDA a bit loud but
      I mean it&#39;s brunch so! <br><br>I definitely recommend trying this place
      because it will probably ruin all other brunch places for you!

      (I guess I could have just said &#34;a typical SF Sunday morning&#34;), my boyfriend
      and I made our way to Sweet Maple for brunch. When we arrived, there was a line
      down the block. I wanted to leave and try somewhere else, but I knew every spot
      would be just as packed. So we stayed and waited it out; and I&#39;m glad we
      did. <br><br>After about 30 minutes, when we were still about 10-15 people from
      the front door, the hostess walked down the line and asked for a party of 2
      for the counter. We jumped on it - literally, I pushed my boyfriend forward
      before anyone else could snag the spots. Sorry babe!<br><br>Anyways, we took
      our seats at the counter and placed our order - we had plenty of time to decide
      what we wanted to eat while we waited in line. I opted for the Blackstone Benedict;
      a classic Benedict with their infamous Millionaire&#39;s Bacon, asparagus, tomatoes,
      and hollandaise on top of English muffins. It was served with a side of potatoes.
      Yum. Yum. Yum. Super filling and the Millionaire&#39;s Bacon added a nice touch
      of sweetness to counter the savory and the salty. <br><br>My boyfriend ordered
      the breakfast tacos and he thoroughly enjoyed them. We both wanted a little
      something sweet, so we split an order of the sweet potato pancakes. Cinnamon,
      sweet potato goodness! They were fantastic.<br><br>Long story short: long wait,

      arugula, tomatoes, scrambled eggs, Gouda, and aioli. I substituted the Gouda
      for pepper jack and it was perfect! I had the sweetest from the bacon, but the

      her mouth for a hot second. The bacon too didn&#39;t help since it was also
      somewhat sweet. <br><br>Marnier w/ side of millionaire&#39;s bacon and eggs:
      4/5 <br>This French Toast has a citrusy flavor to it due to the marmalade batter.
      But again, same thing with the Crunch Flake, it was getting too sweet towards
      the end and the eggs and bacon was not enough to wash down the sugary French
      Toast. <br><br>Swedish pancakes w/ side of millionaire&#39;s bacon and eggs:
      4/5<br>Thin pancakes that were bigger than your head! It was light and airy
      and went well with the bacon alone. Try to separate eggs and bacon so they don&#39;t
      mix in with the syrup when you pour it onto the pancakes.<br><br>Overall, we
      enjoyed our breakfast, but moral of the story...beware if you&#39;re not use
      to sugary breakfasts!'

    :body: The place doesn&#39;t take reservations and there is usually a line. But
      it moves pretty quickly. The restaurant is super cute and clean! I had the French
      toast. So yummy. As an entree we had the breakfast pizza and the Millionaire
      Bacon sandwich. The deep fried French toast is wonderful. Tastes like funnel
      cake but better. It&#39;s got a very crispy edge and it&#39;s just lovely. The
      syrup is warm and delicious! <br><br>The standard American breakfast stuff is
      on the menu but produced in really good quantities with outstanding bacon and
      hash browns. <br><br>Great food &amp; ambience. Good waiting staff who were
      quite happy to explain the menu options. Make sure you arrive to Sweet Maple
      with large appetite&#39;s because they do not serve small portions!

    :body: Owns by the same owner of kitchen story, Blackwood, Taylor street sweet,
      so if you&#39;ve been to those locations, this one isn&#39;t much different.
      <br><br>My friend was visiting during winter and wanted to try food here so
      we went for brunch. Waited in the cold wind for 30 mins. water is served at
      the front if anyone in the line gets thirsty. <br><br>But they can do better
      if they have a waitlist, not letting people wait outside in the wind or rain?
      Dont understand the marketing purpose of some restaurants by taking away the
      waiting list and let people just stand in line to show that they are Popular,
      and just let people waste time in the line. Caught cold afterwards. <br><br>Regarding
      the food, except the bacon, the other dishes aren&#39;t outstanding. We ordered
      bacon flight, for 2 people, that&#39;s too oily and too much. We were only able
      to try two and boxed the rest. Not worth the wait. Don&#39;t understand the
      hype and why some people wait for an hour. Will never come here again.

      a friend recommended this place! Like other places in SF parking is terrible
      but after a couple of rounds you should be able to find parking on the street.
      The line wasn&#39;t too long around 12pm but boy was it packed! They have an

      ever eaten in my life. One bite and I was hooked, I basically devoured the bacon
      before I even touched my dish! I decided to order the Wild Benedict and Friends
      (mushroom medley with meyer lemon hollandaise). I honestly don&#39;t like runny
      yolks but by god did this change my mind about eggs benedict! The mushrooms
      were juicy and just complimented the dish very well. The hollandaise was just
      on point. I basically ate every last bite there was on the plate. Their portions
      are also huge! I didn&#39;t expect there to be a lot of potatoes but I wasn&#39;t
      complaining since it was good. <br><br>As mentioned the ONLY downside to the
      place is how cramped it can get. I felt like I barely had any room and the tables
      were a bit close to each other. Another thing was you kinda have to shout a

      sight seeing, good eats, shopping, and people watching. Even before you get
      to the Ferry Building you encounter street vendors selling a variety of products,
      jewelry, and art. <br><br>My previous visits I&#39;ve walked the building once
      or twice stopping at each of the shops looking for gift inspiration and just
      enjoying all the unique products. This is a really great place to get someone
      a San Francisco souvenir that isn&#39;t your standard &#34;souvenir.&#34; <br><br>On
      my most recent visit we were looking to grab some lunch and we came here knowing
      we would have a variety of options to choose from. After enjoying our meal it

      shops. I take all my guests to Humphry Slocomb for ice cream. Those who like

      get acquainted with its functions with and without a tripod. I made sure to
      set up the tripod in a remote area outside the sidewalk area to shoot the boats
      coming in.  I made sure there wasn&#39;t much foot traffic in the spot I set
      up where I had planned to be for a short time.<br><br>After about ten minutes
      of shooting I switched to handheld mode without the tripod that was in front
      of me blocking no one.  As I was filming, suddenly two security guards were
      there to tell me tripods aren&#39;t allowed at the Ferry Building.  The manner
      they communicated was just ridiculous, all they had to do was say something
      like, &#34;when you&#39;re done with this shot, can you please take down the
      tripod?&#34;  No, they stood there waiting for action interrupting my day waiting
      for me to pack it up, that&#39;s how insane they were.  They also responded
      to my &#34;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re asking me to do this, San Francisco&#39;s
      a tourist area&#34; without compromise that the young man began to reach for
      his radio having little patience well prepared to call for back up police escorts.
      I ended it by telling him I&#39;d be leaving soon (because my battery was dying
      anyway.) <br><br>They ruined a nice day, no one wants to be bossed around on
       a day you take off from work to do a hobby. This was just plain wrong.  Can&#39;t
      they find something better to do? I&#39;ve been here living in San Francisco
      25 years and when I try to enjoy it like a tourist they start harassing me the
      very moment I begin to enjoy my free time.  It takes a lot for me to get out
      of my apartment, I don&#39;t like crowds.  The poor tourists are likely driven
      away from SF for these reasons along with the ridiculous plastic straw laws.

      value, but it&#39;s pretty clear there is a set price for the vegetables and
      fruit regardless of the stand, and the other accoutrements are pricey when compared
      to the same item at a market east of San Francisco.<br><br>One of the best bets
      for food would be the breakfast sandwich by the vendor who is next to the porcini
      sandwich vendor. For under $8 you can get a really great tasting breakfast sandwich.
      They also serve a seasonal soft shell crab sandwich that is really quite special.
      The porcini sandwich is solid, and has been featured on food network. Finally,
      towards the middle of the market is a lox sandwich shop that is good as well.

      along the piers. The ferry building is often compared to a smaller version of
      pike&#39;s place in Seattle and is filled with a cornucopia of shops. Ranging
      from gourmet olive oil stands (with free samples!!) to local farmers selling
      mulberries, this place is fun for all ages. However, it is rather busy on the
      weekends, so keep that in mind.<br><br>The indoor section has many artisan stores
      selling cheese, candles, and breads. Most importantly, if you&#39;re like me,
      it has FREE SAMPLES which makes browsing around and shopping way more interesting.

      is filled with food and produce vendors (at least on the weekends). I love the
      fruit stands in particular. <br><br>Overall, the ambiance (at least indoors)

      family on a Sunday. Easy to get to from the Embarc BART station. But, hard to
      find parking. I wish there were cheaper options for locals to park. On this
      day, we planned to spend the whole day in the city, so BART at night was out
      of the question with the kids.<br><br>One glaring oversight. Restrooms. The
      men&#39;s side was ok, but all the female restrooms were always 20+ women deep.
      I can&#39;t imagine having to take a piss real bad only to find a line that

      get acquainted with its functions with and without a tripod. I made sure to

      they communicated was just ridiculous, all they had to do was say something
      like, &#34;when you&#39;re done with this shot, can you please take down the
      tripod?&#34;  No, they stood there waiting for action interrupting my day waiting
      for me to pack it up, that&#39;s how insane they were.  They also responded
      to my &#34;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re asking me to do this, San Francisco&#39;s
      a tourist area&#34; without compromise that the young man began to reach for

      25 years and when I try to enjoy it like a tourist they start harassing me the
      very moment I begin to enjoy my free time.  It takes a lot for me to get out

      was just such a boring mall, with Borders as my &#34;entertainment&#34;.  Then
      the bookstore closed and I literally didn&#39;t know what to do in this mall.
       But look at it now, and it now has become basically an Asian food center!  It&#39;s
      crazy.  You&#39;ll see multiple boba shops here, a matcha cafe, a Taiwanese
      Street food stand, Korean fried wings at the food court, and a Japanese fluffy
      pancake cafe.  Not to mention they&#39;re about to open more asian restaurants
      such as a chinese hot pot place.  However, my absolute favorite restaurant at
      this mall is Marugame Udon.  Yum.  I also don&#39;t hate Blaze Pizza.<br><br>After
      you had your fills of asian foods, you could also walk around the mall to check
      out interesting stores such as Miniso and this gigantic candy store whose name
      I don&#39;t remember.  Or, you could do your grocery shopping by going to Trader
      Joe&#39;s.<br><br>With the new theater coming, I think this mall will be even
      busier.  I can&#39;t imagine how hellish the parking will be.  I also heard
      that they&#39;ll open a new Whole Foods at the mall.

  - :body: I used to go to Lowell HS so I would frequent the Stonestown Mall frequently.
      But after graduating and moving to San Mateo, I had not gone back to that mall
      in many many years. When I had gone back a few months ago, it had changed a
      lot! Gone were Tower Records, Good Guys and even Macy&#39;s. For the retail
      stores here, I mainly go for the Apple Store and Express. It feels like this
      mall is more of a foodie destination than for retail stores as they have a great
      selection at the food court and outside. My favorites are Shihlin Taiwan Snacks,
      Marugame udon and the 85 Degrees bakery. Parking on the 19th avenue side can
      be tough so I go to the backside parking lot which is a little better and has
      less traffic congestion.

    :comment: Stonestown mall.
    :body: Wow, this shopping mall has come a long way.  I remember 10 years ago it
      was just such a boring mall, with Borders as my &#34;entertainment&#34;.  Then
      the bookstore closed and I literally didn&#39;t know what to do in this mall.
       But look at it now, and it now has become basically an Asian food center!  It&#39;s
      crazy.  You&#39;ll see multiple boba shops here, a matcha cafe, a Taiwanese
      Street food stand, Korean fried wings at the food court, and a Japanese fluffy
      pancake cafe.  Not to mention they&#39;re about to open more asian restaurants
      such as a chinese hot pot place.  However, my absolute favorite restaurant at
      this mall is Marugame Udon.  Yum.  I also don&#39;t hate Blaze Pizza.<br><br>After
      you had your fills of asian foods, you could also walk around the mall to check
      out interesting stores such as Miniso and this gigantic candy store whose name
      I don&#39;t remember.  Or, you could do your grocery shopping by going to Trader
      Joe&#39;s.<br><br>With the new theater coming, I think this mall will be even
      busier.  I can&#39;t imagine how hellish the parking will be.  I also heard
      that they&#39;ll open a new Whole Foods at the mall.

      on the way back to my car, I had remembered that I&#39;ve been wanting to check

      since I wasn&#39;t looking for anything in particular. When we drove down upper

      and clothing influenced by Southeast Asian styles (i.e. Indian, Thai, Tibetan,
      etc.) The crystal collection at The Love of Ganesha was particularly quite impressive,
      and I liked that the majority of the crystals were natural vs polished. I also
      found that the crystals at The Love of Ganesha were considerably bigger although
      way more affordable than crystals of the same size at my local crystal shops.
      I did end up getting an ammonite crystal and a jade roller from The Love of
      Ganesha. <br><br>The customer service was great. When I was about to ring up
      my ammonite crystal, a jade roller was in a basket by the register. I&#39;ve

      to buy it then. The woman at the register showed me different options of rollers
      that she had behind the counter, including one made of carnelian crystal and
      another jade roller with a ball for muscle relief. I had exhausted my 15 minutes
      at The Love of Ganesha, and the store was already closed off to the public.
      Yet the cashier patiently waited for me to feel out my options, and she didn&#39;t

  - :body: I&#39;m not club person. <br><br>I don&#39;t enjoy the kind of people who
      generally go to clubs, I don&#39;t like being crowded, I hate sweating, and
      I detest the idea of paying a hearty cover fee to go to a place where people
      will totally disregard my personal space. <br><br>Bootie really wasn&#39;t any
      of those things... with the exception of the cover (which is TWENTY F*CKING
      DOLLARS). The music was fun and good. The night we went there was a &#39;90s
      vs 2000s mash-up. A female DJ that I&#39;ve hired for events before was working
      and there was even a cover band made of what seemed like people from all walks
      of life. I was pleasantly surprised with just how safe a place it felt like.
      <br><br>I got one drink while I was there - the only canned beer they have because
      I like knowing my beverage hasn&#39;t been tampered with. The bartender was
      kind of an older gentleman and my beer was only $6.<br><br>The bathroom definitely
      has a prison vibe. Metal toilet, not the cleanest, but there was never a line.
      <br><br>We danced on the lower level while the live band did an incredible job
      mashing up pop songs from the featured decades. When they finished their set
      we moved up to what seemed like the VIP area but I guess it&#39;s open to anyone
      in the know. DJ Airsun was there and the jams were so fun. We moved around the
      room and stage and danced and laughed and enjoyed being in the company of our
      group. There were a handful of times where men tried to approach us but they
      were all relatively respectful and when we made it clear none of us were interested
      or there to be picked up, they left and remained even remained gracious when
      we left that upper level area to seek other geography within the club. <br><br>We
      moved down to the mid level and danced on the stage for a very brief period
      of time - though I do question the safety of that with the way the stairs wrap
      around and no railing on the edge - but everyone seemed to be in control of
      their movements and appeared to be there for nothing more than a good old fashioned
      dance party. <br><br>We ghosted on the club by entering the adjoined counter
      service pizza place (where everyone was also incredibly nice) and all in all
      it was a good night... though admittedly, I&#39;d immediately regretted my decision
      to &#39;rally&#39; and go out with people (90% of which I was meeting for the
      very first time that night) once I got out of my uber due to some semi-crippling
      anxiety I&#39;ve been graced with recently, but I did it, I left my apartment,
      I put on make-up, new shoes, and clean clothes... I didn&#39;t wash my disgusting
      multi-day dirty hair, but I checked a lot of boxes on things that I wouldn&#39;t
      normally do, or at least haven&#39;t done in a very, very long time and I&#39;m
      glad that Bootie SF was the place/night that I earned experience points on.

      in front of the stage that should give you room to dance with your friends unless
      you go on a Saturday night at 12:30AM. If you go too early, it&#39;ll be really
      empty and you&#39;ll probably stand there looking like an idiot. By too early
      I mean 10pm. There is usually no line at 10pm, so don&#39;t bother buying your
      entry fee early online. I went during a burlesque night and it was okay. There
      is also an upstairs area where you can look down on to the dance floor. Bar
      upstairs and downstairs. Music was at most mediocre and there were just a couple
      of good songs - the DJ would mix 2 songs at a time, but some didn&#39;t go well
      together. <br><br>Would I go back again? Maybe. But wouldn&#39;t go often because

      and can arrive at any time and skip the line. Coat check is $3. We ended up
      doing that, and it was worth it. The club really starts filling up around 11:30pm
      or so, and it gets PACKED. The space is large and they play awesome mash-up
      music. At midnight there was a short show that was fun to watch. The bathroom

       It&#39;s an acronym:  Privately Owned Public Open Space.  Did you know that

  - :body: I received a gift certificate for a 90 min scrub and massage at Pearl Spa
      &amp; Sauna from one of my close friends on my birthday. She had recently gone
      to Pearl Spa for the first time and loved it so much that she felt compelled
      to gift the experience to me. My sister, who has been to S. Korea and is also
      a huge fan of Korean spas, highly recommended Pearl Spa to me as well. I&#39;ve
      never been to a Korean Spa before, so I didn&#39;t quite know what to expect.
      I, too, was so blown away by my overall experience at Pearl Spa &amp; Sauna
      that it set the bar for me when it comes to Korean spas. <br><br>I scheduled
      an appointment over the phone with no issues. The employees communicated well,
      and I found that they were very accommodating as I had to reschedule a couple
      of times. I had my appointment set for 9:30am on a Saturday. <br><br>The check-in
      process went smoothly. One of the employees took me and my sister to our lockers
      and showed us around the facility. Pearl Spa &amp; Sauna had 2 floors. The first
      floor had a hot tub, cold pool, sauna, steam room, showers, and a common room
      with snacks, teas, and water. I liked that Pearl Spa &amp; Sauna had all the
      toiletries and amenities you would possibly need, which were also found on the
      first floor. Each shower had shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, and then the
      common room also had body lotion, facial wash, hair dryers, cotton swabs, deodorant,
      sterilized hair brushes, etc. The second floor had a lounge area with couches,
      a heated clay room, and a heated Himalayan salt room. Both floors had lockers
      and restrooms. I thought that the staff did a great job of maintaining the cleanliness
      of the place. <br><br>Good thing my sister tagged along with me, because I was
      clueless of the process. My sister explained that I had to shower before getting
      into the pools and basically soak first while I waited my turn to be called
      for my scrub and massage. While waiting I took advantage of the jacuzzi, cold
      pool, and steam room. Damn that steam room was intense, but I felt like I was
      really detoxifying my body. By the time I was called to my session 30 minutes
      later, I was deeply relaxed. <br><br>I absolutely loved the scrub and massage!
      I don&#39;t exfoliate my entire body on a regular basis, so I definitely was
      due for the scrub. My scrubber/masseuse was Jessica. She was this tiny Korean
      lady, but I was so impressed by her strength during the massage (I asked for
      medium-firm pressure) and her thoroughness during the scrub. I felt super clean,
      and I also loved how smooth my skin felt. What I thought was really cool was
      the warm milk bath that was part of the session. <br><br>After the scrub and
      massage, I joined my sister in the Himalayan salt room for the last few minutes
      of our time at the spa. I have a Himalayan salt lamp in my space at home, so
      I&#39;m all about the benefits of it. Being in a room made entirely of Himalayan
      salts was wonderful to me. I&#39;ll have to check out the clay room next door
      on my next visit, which I&#39;m already looking forward to.

      scrub only for 30 minutes, and it also included a brief massage, body wash,
      and hair washing! <br><br>Afterwards, we explored the clay and salt rooms which

      experience at a spa, and it went above and beyond my expectations. My friend
      and I arrived 30 mins before our exfoliating body scrub, and we were greeted
      by the extremely friendly staff, who showed us around the spa. We put our stuff
      in lockers and got undressed (no bathing suits allowed). We were able to get
      through most of the services before our scrub. General service is $35 and includes
      the sauna, hot tub, cold tub, stone room, salt room, and steam room. We payed
      $60 total which included general services and the scrub service (so an extra
      $25).<br><br>The scrub was incredible. It definitely felt a bit rough for someone
      who&#39;s never done a scrub like that before, but it really did remove all
      my dead skin on my body. I mean, I could see it all on the table. They use one
      of those exfoliating gloves and really get every inch of your body. They also
      apply massage oil after you get scrubbed down, and give your a quick massage.
      Lastly, they&#39;ll finish the service with a hair wash! My skin felt so so
      soft after, I couldn&#39;t stop touching it. I loved how they added in a mini
      massage and hair wash at the end.<br><br>All the ladies at the spa were so nice
      and sweet. What I loved most about this place was the small details. For example,
      the vanity room was stocked not only with hair and body products and hair tools,
      but also snacks, fruit, tea, and water. They also give you a towel and a cute
      little robe to wear around the place. When we were all finished and about to
      leave, they even gave each of us a face mask! All these things really made this

      and conditioned my hair. It&#39;s literally heaven.

  - :body: I love the Korean saunas in Korea but we never really had one in SF and
      the closest and best comparison I experienced in the US is WiiSpa in LA so I
      was really excited when I heard this spa was opening up! I would recommend this
      spa if you want to pamper yourself with a service which you can book online
      but if you&#39;re looking to use the communal areas, I&#39;d recommend going
      over to Kabuki because it&#39;s a bit small here especially if there are a lot
      of people and Kabuki has a bigger communal area for relaxation. <br><br>I booked
      a body scrub and oil treatment and also received a mini facial and hair wash
      which is great since I was only expecting a scrub and oil massage! Instead of
      shirts and pants, they give you robes to wear and walk around in. There are
      also shorts provided for you to wear of you want to go into the salt room. <br><br>This
      spa is always booked up so I usually book my appointment at least a month in
      advance. They recently changed their online booking system and you can only
      book one month in advance. If you have an appointment for a oil massage service,
      come early to use the hot tub since apparently it&#39;s not good to use the
      hot tub after an oil treatment.

    :body: THIS SPA IS ANAZING, would highly recommend. <br><br>This was my first
      experience at a spa, and it went above and beyond my expectations. My friend
      and I arrived 30 mins before our exfoliating body scrub, and we were greeted
      by the extremely friendly staff, who showed us around the spa. We put our stuff
      in lockers and got undressed (no bathing suits allowed). We were able to get
      through most of the services before our scrub. General service is $35 and includes
      the sauna, hot tub, cold tub, stone room, salt room, and steam room. We payed
      $60 total which included general services and the scrub service (so an extra
      $25).<br><br>The scrub was incredible. It definitely felt a bit rough for someone
      who&#39;s never done a scrub like that before, but it really did remove all
      my dead skin on my body. I mean, I could see it all on the table. They use one
      of those exfoliating gloves and really get every inch of your body. They also
      apply massage oil after you get scrubbed down, and give your a quick massage.
      Lastly, they&#39;ll finish the service with a hair wash! My skin felt so so
      soft after, I couldn&#39;t stop touching it. I loved how they added in a mini
      massage and hair wash at the end.<br><br>All the ladies at the spa were so nice
      and sweet. What I loved most about this place was the small details. For example,
      the vanity room was stocked not only with hair and body products and hair tools,
      but also snacks, fruit, tea, and water. They also give you a towel and a cute
      little robe to wear around the place. When we were all finished and about to
      leave, they even gave each of us a face mask! All these things really made this

      we re-stain it with solid stain rather than semi-transparent stain because it&#39;s
      an older deck (even though he could have charged much more had we gone with
      semi-transparent stain).  He also suggested a color that we were initially skeptical
      about because we thought it was too dark, but he told us that based on his experience
      he was confident it would look lighter on the deck than on paper.  He was right.

      chip cookie flavor. I really want to know how they flavored it for it to taste
      like a cookie! I was hoping it would taste more like cookies than latte, but

      here like the hangover (sparkling americano), red velvet latte and lavender
      latte to name a few. I like that they also reserve a few tables for no laptops.
      It can get pretty packed here since this is the smaller of the two locations,
      but worth it for the free wifi. You have to ask them for the pw, but last time
      I went the password was welcomehome. Happy caffeinating!

      Ordered Seoul Much Avo (Avocado Sourdough toast with Chopped Kimchi and seeds)
      for breakfast with a nice cup of Caffe Latte. I asked to make sure they use

      there is barely any wait. They have tables and bar style seating inside. Since
      many people like to come and hang out or do work on their laptops here, there
      are specific tables where it is strictly for eating/enjoying coffee AND tables

      cool latte art. The menu is filled with various different lattes to choose from.
      I went for the hazelnut latte which was very good. They also have options if
      you&#39;re lactose intolerant. Did you know oat milk is a thing? Well I didn&#39;t
      till I came here and apparently when swapped with regular milk in lattes it&#39;s
      barely noticeable that it&#39;s not regular milk! <br><br>The workers were super
      nice and very helpful about any questions I had. They also have types of toast
      if you want a little snack as well. I did not get the chance to try it but I
      definitely will the next time I am here.<br><br>What&#39;s not to love about
      this cafe? From it&#39;s cute and simple decor you really can&#39;t go wrong.
      It&#39;s the perfect place to bring your laptop and get some work done while

      It&#39;s clearly mentioned on the wall and the reason for it is given as well,

    :comment: Cute Latte Art
    :body: We definitely need more this type of local cute little coffee shop in the
      Sunset area! Staffs are very friendly. The place has good atmosphere, very chill.
      Ordered Seoul Much Avo (Avocado Sourdough toast with Chopped Kimchi and seeds)
      for breakfast with a nice cup of Caffe Latte. I asked to make sure they use
      two shots of espresso for the Latte. The toast is very interesting as I like
      avocado and I like kimchi, is just I never have Avo and kimchi eat together
      and they are good match. If you can&#39;t eat too spicy, I will not suggest
      to try the Seoul Much Avo as they put hot red pepper flicks for garnish and
      give you the spicy kick! <br><br>I came on a Wednesday morning around 10am and
      the place is almost full. I like they put the signs to restrict the use of lab
      tops on the tables as you do need to slow down and enjoy your coffee and breakfast
      instead of watching the computer and you don&#39;t know what you are eating.

      pretty and tasty. The egg in the hole is cute too. This spot is busy but great
      for working and being in the zone as well as some good eats while you do it.

    :comment: Red velvet, hazelnut, and birthday cake lattes
    :body: One of the reasons my friends and I stopped by here was because of the
      cool latte art. The menu is filled with various different lattes to choose from.
      I went for the hazelnut latte which was very good. They also have options if
      you&#39;re lactose intolerant. Did you know oat milk is a thing? Well I didn&#39;t
      till I came here and apparently when swapped with regular milk in lattes it&#39;s
      barely noticeable that it&#39;s not regular milk! <br><br>The workers were super
      nice and very helpful about any questions I had. They also have types of toast
      if you want a little snack as well. I did not get the chance to try it but I
      definitely will the next time I am here.<br><br>What&#39;s not to love about
      this cafe? From it&#39;s cute and simple decor you really can&#39;t go wrong.
      It&#39;s the perfect place to bring your laptop and get some work done while
      enjoying a latte. It is a bit small so it can fill up quickly so my suggestion
      is come a little early if you&#39;re planning on hanging out for a bit.

      feel like your typical fast food.  Well... because it definitely is not fast!
       If you&#39;re willing to wait (or call ahead), it&#39;s worth it.  I&#39;ve
      only tried the salads, but the quality is top notch.  Great ingredients &amp;
      the dressing is amazing!  Once they improve the process &amp; flow, I predict
      it will be even more popular than it is now.  <br><br>I would recommend that
      they create a secure covering for the outside since it is often way too windy
      to enjoy the space. The sun&#39;s nice for those who like the sun, so I would
      highly suggest that if they do cover it, to choose something that allows for
      a lot of light &amp; air to pass through.<br><br>I like the sauces already pre-packed
      in small containers vs. those annoying packets!  Also, their cups for water
      are BIG!  This is definitely a first since most places use dinky, tiny cups!
       Lastly, the water is COLD, which I appreciate very much.  I would like the
      option of adding ice myself, but that&#39;s just me being picky.  All in all,
      they have my lunch vote for sure.

      bbq combo with 1.00 extra for kimchi rice. Good thing there was macaroni to
      balance out the spicy and salty.  12.00 was a good price. Nice little place
      to sit and relax.  Wish I can get the shave ice but way too full.  I would like

    :comment: BBQ chicken salad w/an over-easy egg - tasty!!!
    :body: I am thrilled to have a new Hawaiian joint to visit that truly does not
      feel like your typical fast food.  Well... because it definitely is not fast!
       If you&#39;re willing to wait (or call ahead), it&#39;s worth it.  I&#39;ve
      only tried the salads, but the quality is top notch.  Great ingredients &amp;
      the dressing is amazing!  Once they improve the process &amp; flow, I predict
      it will be even more popular than it is now.  <br><br>I would recommend that
      they create a secure covering for the outside since it is often way too windy
      to enjoy the space. The sun&#39;s nice for those who like the sun, so I would
      highly suggest that if they do cover it, to choose something that allows for
      a lot of light &amp; air to pass through.<br><br>I like the sauces already pre-packed
      in small containers vs. those annoying packets!  Also, their cups for water
      are BIG!  This is definitely a first since most places use dinky, tiny cups!
       Lastly, the water is COLD, which I appreciate very much.  I would like the
      option of adding ice myself, but that&#39;s just me being picky.  All in all,
      they have my lunch vote for sure.

    :comment: The meat combo-one slice of each-short rib, chicken, and beef.  Salty
      kimchi rice.
    :body: Kimchi rice too salty. A bit of a spicy kick. Ask them for the kimchi aioli
      sauce behind counter.  That was good.  A bit of a wait so don&#39;t think you
      can order and go.  Mine was 10 min wait and it wasn&#39;t that busy. I had the
      bbq combo with 1.00 extra for kimchi rice. Good thing there was macaroni to
      balance out the spicy and salty.  12.00 was a good price. Nice little place
      to sit and relax.  Wish I can get the shave ice but way too full.  I would like
      to try the loco moco next time.  They open at 7 am and serve breakfast only.
      After 10 am is the lunch menu.

    :body: Beware quality gone way downhill. Short ribs burnt and barely any meat

      as a huge puzzle! <br><br>At first, I was slightly wary of how enjoyable it
      would be due to the large amount of people inside. However, it was still very
      fun and trippy! Some people were walking around and jamming out with the lights
      and music too! It can get slightly annoying when big groups stand in one spot
      and block ways though. <br><br>Overall, this is a cool and affordable activity

      been in a mirror maze and it was such a confusing and fascinating experience!
      Admission is super affordable ($5 per person) so you can come with friends or
      you can make it a fun experience for the family! Before you go in, they give
      you these clear plastic gloves so that you don&#39;t leave any finger prints
      on the mirrors. This helps us not spoil the fun for other people! The maze was
      pretty quick to complete, it took us about 10 minutes or so to figure out the
      way to go. I&#39;d definitely recommend this maze for all ages. Super fun and
      a great experience for the small price.

      One day we even came back a few times to see if they reopened - nope. <br>Just
      called to see if I could reserve a time to make sure they are open so I could
      bring my work team in (almost 20 people) and they said they dont take reservations
      and that they close for breaks during slow times, specifically lunch and dinner.
      The guy on the phone would not guarantee that they would be open when we would
      come in, and said theres a chance that they place would be closed for 30 mins
      while someone takes their break. He was pretty rude and hung up while i was
      saying &#34;thank you&#34; lol.<br> I am not taking my entire team there only
      to find out they are closed - that would be a huge buzz kill. Also, they dont

      4 for $10! Versus $5 each, there. It&#39;s a quick maze to get through, maybe
      10 minutes or so. The little one loved it so much he wanted to go again and

      your day. I found a discount when buying through the Yelp link and signed myself
      and my boyfriend up for this maze. When we arrived, we couldn&#39;t find the
      place at first. Turns out it was hidden upstairs in a hallway. When we arrived,
      there was a sign on the door that said the staff were out to lunch. Although
      it was 7-8PM. We were wondering if we were going to miss the closing time. They
      luckily extended their hours when the staff member came back. Wasn&#39;t fun
      waiting in the cold though. Still a nice view and lots of food / picturesque
      moments.<br><br>I like the uncertainty of where you&#39;re at. Being in this
      maze, it was fun but it took us a long time to get out! They did a great job
      with the illusions of mirrors. Wasn&#39;t sure if I was walking into a mirror
      or open space. Typically it&#39;s $5/ person and it takes about 30 mins - 1
      hour. Great for kids, just watch your kids!

      risks. Instead, she&#39;s dutiful, organized, attentive, and punctual. Anyone

      without Ruth and her team, we do not move into our dream house 30 days later.<br><br>We
      felt supported by the Krishnan Team every step of the way. Communication was
      fantastic--near real-time responses at any hour of any day. She put us in touch
      with David, the best mortgage expert I could have imagined. When it came time
      to prepare our offer, Ruth and team patiently walked us through all the disclosures
      and helped us craft a stand-out package. And when it came down to the final
      negotiations, she positioned us to beat a cash offer and get into contract without

      of the park.  It was a challenging sale with many moving parts and Ruth kept
      things on track, running smoothly, and was able to sell my property for nearly
      20% over asking in 4 days, while the rest of listings in the area were sitting.
       Her thoughtful, no-nonsense approach coupled with incredible knowledge of the
      market and dream team of vendors, made for a clear and easy path to success.

  - :body: As first time home-buyers we really truly benefited from Ruth&#39;s expertise
      and knowledge in not-only the home-buying process but also the specifics and
      peculiarities of the SF market.  She took the time up-front to try to understand,
      in-depth, the type of property we were looking for, counseled us as to what
      we would need to be prepared for and really took the time to educate us so that
      there were as few surprises as possible.  Ruth pulls no punches and with each
      property we looked at, advised us as to how its assets and potential liabilities
      would impact resale potential and value. <br><br>Once we found the place we
      wanted to buy, she helped us strategize on the bid process, wasted no time in
      helping us prepare the offer (she and her team really lept into action) which
      was submitted within the offer deadline less than 24 hours after we viewed the
      loft.  Most importantly, Ruth did the background reconnaissance with the other
      agents to understand how many other bids were being submitted, the status and
      what price the seller would accept.  It turns out we got our property for less
      than what we were prepared to offer; which meant that we had to re-write our
      bid (more work but awesome!) and I think Ruth was as excited as we were about
      that (even though it meant less commission).<br><br>Ruth and her team are a
      well-oiled machine.  Her network of advisors and service providers has also
      been incredibly helpful throughout the buying, closing a and post-purchase periods.<br><br>Ruth
      is wonderful to work with and a highly skilled professional.  I hope she&#39;ll
      sell our loft for us when the time comes and highly recommend her to anyone
      looking to buy (or sell) in SF.

      were pretty unfocused in what we wanted in the beginning, but Ruth helped us
      understand what we essentially wanted by looking at a lot of different houses
      in many neighborhoods throughout San Francisco. She was knowledgeable about
      different neighborhoods, pointed out the pros and cons of every house we considered,
      and was honest with her opinions. <br><br>What we also liked about Ruth is that
      she was aggressive during negotiations, but didn&#39;t push us into making decisions
      until we were ready. She was very supportive even when a negotiation went badly
      and we had to walk away from a house, and even helped us navigate these situations
      at a potential cost to her own reputation. After working with our schedules,
      including going over disclosures page by page late at night, Ruth and the Krishnan
      team eventually helped us buy our current home, which we love!

  - :body: Everything from the service to the food at Howlin&#39; is worthy of 5 stars.<br><br>FOOD
      COMPARISON:<br>- The classic comparison to Howlin&#39; Ray&#39;s is the famous
      Hattie B&#39;s Hot Chicken out of Nashville. And although Howlin&#39; was actually
      inspired by Hattie B&#39;s, I traveled and tried Hattie&#39;s twice and Howlin&#39;
      completely and utterly blows Hattie&#39;s out of the park.<br><br>THE SANDO:<br>-
      I&#39;ve had Howlin&#39; twice now and both times I was actually in awe of how
      good the food was. First time I got the sando in medium plus and the second
      time I tried it in the medium. I can personally eat extremely spicy food but
      for the sando, I preferred the overall flavor and taste of the medium. Definitely
      beware as anything hot and above is actually really spicy. The JUICINESS of
      the chicken alone is incredible.<br><br>SIDES:<br>- Honestly, I&#39;m not a
      huge fan of the sides but a lot of friends really liked the shake fries. Definitely
      nice to have something on the side to munch on though.<br><br>DRINKS:<br>- Mix
      the peach tea and lemonade together<br><br>SERVICE:<br>- If you can, I&#39;d
      definitely try to eat inside the restaurant at the bar. Not only do you get
      showered with free food but the employees are super duper friendly and it honestly
      adds so much to the overall eating experience.<br><br>PARKING:<br>- This is
      the greatest secret that nobody knows but there is actually a parking structure
      connected to the plaza. It&#39;s a very small entrance that you can spot if
      you drive around the block but parking is free for 2 hours with validation from
      Howlin&#39;. This is definitely worth it as the line usually won&#39;t be past
      1.5 - 2 hours unless you go during its peak. <br><br>TWITTER:<br>Make sure you
      check the Howlin&#39; Ray&#39;s Twitter throughout the day you&#39;re planning
      on going as they regularly update what the current wait time is.

      wait in my opinion. I only come by when it&#39;s 45 minutes, otherwise I go
      to Dave&#39;s if I&#39;m really craving hot chicken since there&#39;s never

      for once. A lot of places that are hyped as fuck like this tend to be shitty
      in my opinion, but man the wait really is worth it here.<br><br>The line is
      always long as fuck, I waited 1 hour and 40 minutes to get to the register,
      and this is probably the fastest fucking wait you could get on a normal day!<br><br>Anyway,
      I ordered a medium spice level Sando. It was SO FUCKING GOOD BRUH. I&#39;d be
      down to wait another hour for this shit, but idk about 3 hours.<br><br>The customer
      service here is OVERLY nice... Kind of annoying tbh... If you&#39;re not a people
      person you won&#39;t like eating inside here. They talk too much and are way
      too nice to you... The only good thing I like about this is that they gave us
      free waffles with our order and boy were those some of the BEST fucking waffles
      I ever had. Damn I want more...<br><br>It&#39;s surprisingly cool inside, from
      the outside it looked like it would be hot as fuck sitting in there and eating
      a hot chicken sandwich in such heat didn&#39;t sound appealing at all. But it
      was AC&#39;d so that&#39;s nice.<br><br>P.S. The MEDIUM Sando is the perfect
      spice level for taste and spiciness. I mean it wasn&#39;t spicy at all to me,
      but my friends ordered shit that was above medium and they honestly tasted like
      shit (I tried each one). I highly recommend medium spice.<br><br>Like, I can
      HANDLE spicy easily; the spicy noodle challenge isn&#39;t shit to me, but I
      don&#39;t like the taste of spiciness in general since it overwhelms the flavor
      of everything else imo. So it&#39;s NOT like I don&#39;t dislike the spicier
      items here because I can&#39;t handle them, I dislike their spicier items here
      because it sucks ass in taste. Don&#39;t get anything spicier than medium here.

      me to do this. ITS. TOO. HYPED. UP.<br><br>My girlfriend and I have heard so
      much about this place. SO much. We have been here twice. Once the line was 2.5
      hours, then we went back to see if our opinions changed at all. The second time
      we came at opening and the line was an hour long.<br><br>The lines are insane,
      ridiculous, crazy, mindboggling, absurd, unbelievable, unnerving even. But,
      we waited. We ordered medium sandos and medium wings. We wanted hot but nothing
      that would take away from the sandwich by our mouths becoming an inferno. <br><br>The
      first thing I noticed was the delicious smell emitting from the bag. HOLY COW.
      This must be what heaven smells like. We opened our box and inside were 5/5
      looking sandwiches. However, the wings looked overly seasoned. The looked like
      they fell in a bucket of seasoning. Still looked deliciously crispy though!<br><br>It
      was the moment of truth. I looked at my girlfriend and said &#34;These better
      be the best damn sandwiches we have ever had.&#34; I took my bite and I said
      verbatim &#34;It&#39;s good...not 3 hours good, but its good.&#34; <br><br>Honestly,
      maybe I expected to feel this way which is why I wasn&#39;t wowed.  I was really
      hoping for a 5 star review. I wanted this to be life-changing. My girlfriend
      thought the same thing. She started not to like it that much halfway through
      because of the thick coating of spices on it. This stuff coated our hands with
      a thick layer of spice. I know that&#39;s how its supposed to be but I just
      couldn&#39;t fall in love with it.<br><br>The level of heat was perfect and
      is exactly what I wanted. They had that down perfect. The sando was assembled
      perfectly. Perfect amounts of each topping. Just to much dang caked on spice
      mix, ESPECIALLY on the wings. <br><br>The staff is solid though. These guys
      are amazing. The best of the best with customer service and friendliness. Nothing
      else like it.<br><br>For some odd reason though, I catch myself craving these
      often. Its strange. Each time I have gotten one, I was underwhelmed, and felt
      like crap after. But there&#39;s something about them that does make them very
      good. If there was no long line, or found a way to lessen the wait they&#39;d
      get 4 stars maybe. But there is nothing out of this world about this place besides
      the wait time. Angry Birdz is just as comparable to me. Don&#39;t kill me.

      This was probably one of the BEST chicken sandwiches I&#39;ve had in a really
      long time. I got mild, but I was hesitant, but I think next time I would opt
      for the medium. Really, this chicken sandwich is a beast, and worth every delicious
      bite. <br>- Fries: I was not expecting the fries to be so tasty, but they were.
      Perfectly crispy and well salted<br>- Cole slaw: Kind of an after thought. Not
      to say that it wasn&#39;t delicious, but when the chicken sandwich and fries
      were perfection, anything less than perfection seems mediocre at best. <br><br>Pros:<br>-

      queueing for about 1.5 hours on a Friday morning and giving up because he had
      only moved probably 15 feet and was still far away from the entrance. Fast forward

      and all of it with a nice little kick! Would I queue up 2.5-3 hours for this?
      Probably not because my sleep and sanity is more important, but for 45 minutes
      I most definitely would! I also ordered the solo chicken wing on the side ($3)
      because I was feeling super extra today *weird flex but ok* it was a generous
      portion and worth ordering to try. Also ordered the chicken tenders and an extra
      medium spicy chicken sando for my derpventure bae. We each had one of the &#34;hot&#34;
      spicy chicken tenders and holy shhhhhhh our stomachs hated us for a good 8 hours.
      8/10 would do again next time lol. NO RAHHHHGRETS.<br><br>Now I&#39;m itching
      to try the chicken and waffles. I&#39;ll have to report back on my findings
      when I do! The employees who work here are friendly, hilarious, and definitely
      go above and beyond to make sure you come back for extras the next time you
      stop by! Thanks for the extra chicken leg, cheers! Best decision we&#39;ve made
      all week, ayyyyy'

  - :body: 'Everything about Howlin&#39; Ray&#39;s deserves 5 stars.<br><br>Yes, there
      is a long wait and yes, we showed up 45 minutes before opening. But it doesn&#39;t
      detract from the experience at all.<br><br>The staff handles the volume of customers
      impeccably. Everyone behind the counter was friendly, efficient, and full of
      energy. They did their jobs smoothly while still managing to take photos and
      chit chat with the customers. <br><br>Next, the food. The Sandro is the classic
      order. Absolutely amazing. The chicken was crispy on the outside, tender and
      juicy on the inside. There was just enough breading on the outside, and I&#39;d
      say medium level is the perfect amount of spice. Sidenote: the fries are good
      too. <br><br>We also got a box of Howlin&#39; rated spicy wings. They give you
      gloves to eat them with and give you a thorough warning about the spice level.
      It&#39;s worth trying for the fun of it but my stomach didn&#39;t feel so great
      later on in the day :) Still a good experience and a fun story to tell. <br><br>Overall,
      this place lives up to the hype and is worth the wait!'

    :body: Even if I don&#39;t love their chicken, I would still give this place a
      4 star just for their service. Luckily I didn&#39;t have to wait in line because
      I had someone else to do it for me (what baby brother is for), got food super
      quickly and ate at the benches outside their store. <br><br>We tried the howlin
      spicy chicken wings, X-hot sando sandwich, and they gave us free sides, waffles,
      and more chicken when they were closing! <br><br>Let me tell you the spicy level
      here is no joke, it will burn your lips, tongue, your eyes will water, your
      nose will run and run like a fosset. For those who can&#39;t even spicy, just
      get their mild, don&#39;t even try to kill your stomach and taste buds. <br><br>The
      service is amazing, they keep checking on us nonstop and giving us so much water.
      The workers are genuinely really good people. Thanks for that!

    :body: 'REDEMPTION!!! Alright, here&#39;s the story, paraphrased of course. A
      month ago, my coworker was telling me about his feeble attempt to go here and
      queueing for about 1.5 hours on a Friday morning and giving up because he had

      order. Absolutely amazing. The chicken was crispy on the outside, tender and
      juicy on the inside. There was just enough breading on the outside, and I&#39;d
      say medium level is the perfect amount of spice. Sidenote: the fries are good
      too. <br><br>We also got a box of Howlin&#39; rated spicy wings. They give you
      gloves to eat them with and give you a thorough warning about the spice level.
      It&#39;s worth trying for the fun of it but my stomach didn&#39;t feel so great

      was mildly annoying but the food itself was pretty good. The fries were excellent
      and not too salty. I was a fan of the aioli, but not so much of the Thai peanut
      sauce - it seemed like it would be better on a salad or sandwich than with fries.
      Overall the food was good and the portions were just right to keep us full for
      the rest of the day.<br><br>There is street parking and lots that you can pay

      have been to Wurstkuche at least 7 times, and the quality level has remained
      top notch. Every time I go, the food and the experience is excellent. Not all
      sausages are created equal, but there&#39;s a baseline of greatness that every
      item I&#39;ve had maintains. My top 3 so far are as follows: 1. Bratwurst, 2.
      Duck &amp; Bacon, 3. Lousiana Hot Link. <br><br>The Bratwurst is one of the
      cheaper options, but don&#39;t let that fool you--it&#39;s the best thing on
      the menu (other than the fries). It is consistently perfectly juicy, perfectly
      seasoned and every bite explodes with flavor. With all Wurstkuche sausages,
      the buns are nicely textured and have a great, flat symmetrical grill mark on
      each side. <br><br>The Duck &amp; Bacon is my most recent discovery, and while
      it&#39;s one of the pricier options, it&#39;s well worth a try. It trends a
      little more savory (like bacon), so it&#39;s complimented nicely with onions
      and sweet peppers. The Lousiana Hot Link satisfies your spicy needs, and is
      a great third option for me. <br><br>The fries, however, are out of this world.
      They are thick cut, but perfectly crispy. They are deliciously seasoned on their
      own, but Wurstkuche takes it a step further and offers a slew of delicious dipping
      sauces for your fries. Every time I&#39;ve gone, the chipotle aioli has been
      a favorite, as well as the pesto mayo. Almost every dipping sauce on the menu
      is a knockout, though.<br><br>For the quality, Wurstkuche remains the best casual,

      place since there was always a line out the door.  You wait in line, order your
      food, and then head to the back where all the seats and shared benches are.
       I loved how chill the atmosphere was, and it seemed like not only a place with
      good food but also a nice place to catch up with your friends over a couple
      of beers and hotdogs.  I&#39;m definitely planning to come back to try their
      other sausages for my next Little Tokyo trip and perhaps get a glass of beer
      as well. <br><br>|| L O C A T I O N / P A R K I N G ||<br>-Within walking distance
      from Little Tokyo<br>-right across from The Pie Hole and in close proximity
      of two breweries (Angel City Brewery &amp; Arts District Brewing Co. )<br>-I
      suggest parking in the structures at Little Tokyo.  It seems to be easier than
      finding street parking.<br><br>|| F O O D ||<br>I had many rounds of food beforehand
      and this was my last stop.  I regret having this as my last stop because I wished
      I got my own hot dog.  The bf and I shared (1) Duck &amp; Bacon Hotdog with
      the large Belgian fries paired with the Chipotle Aioli and Pesto Mayo.  <br><br>Duck
      &amp; Bacon Hot Dog (caramelized onions &amp; sweet peppers) - I would have
      never known that duck and bacon would go so well together.  I was afraid it
      would be too oily since duck is on the oiler side, but it was perfect.  The
      sausage was bursting with flavors and paired with the sweet peppers and caramelized
      onions , it was absolutely scrumptious.  For once I finished my actual entree
      sooner than the fries, and I&#39;m a big fries lover!<br><br>Belgian Fries -
      My favorite type of fries are actually shoestring fries, or something along
      the thinner side of fries, but despite that, these were absolutely divine with
      their dipping sauces.  It was my first time trying Belgian fries and I didn&#39;t
      know what to expect.  I recommend getting the large size so you can get 2 dipping
      sauces.  I was pleasantly in love with the pesto mayo and couldn&#39;t stop
      dipping my fries in it.  The sauce wasn&#39;t so overbearingly heavy which was
      what I liked about it.  <br><br>I&#39;m definitely getting a beer and my own
      hotdog the next time I visit here.

    :body: Craft beer and Lamb Cut hot dogs... so what else could you ask for!? The
      flavor packed into the cuts of hot dogs are phenomenal! I would say their selection
      choices are wide range for both beer and protein options. <br><br>The eating
      area wraps around to the back and has an bar in the back in a picnic table like
      sitting area. The place was clean, well taken care of and the employees presented
      as if they liked their job which is always a plus.<br><br>I&#39;d say service
      here is a bit subpar during my experience but maybe we just had a gentleman
      who was having a rough go or slow morning, but was helpful with making suggestions.<br><br>For
      a nice cut of protein it&#39;ll run you about $10 for a hotdog and $7-12 for
      a craft beer. So expect to pay for a $20+ lunch. Welcome to LA haha. Now for
      the French fries I felt that they were lackluster and weren&#39;t that great
      to be honest. They are thick cut but just not great.. honestly if I find myself
      in the area I may go elsewhere but if you craving high quality bratwurst this
      may be your spot!

    :body: We went here on a Sunday afternoon around 1 pm before heading over to Angels
      City Brewery. There was a bit of a line but it moved quickly. They are very
      efficient - you get a number with your order and then head to the back for seating.
      There&#39;s a bunch of communal tables and some smaller tables inside and some
      tables on the patio as well. There are lots of different types of mustards that
      are labeled well.<br><br>We ordered the brockworst and the hot Italian, along
      with large fries that came with two sauces (we go chipotle aioli and Thai peanut).
      The food came out pretty quickly. My sausage burst when I bit into it which
      was mildly annoying but the food itself was pretty good. The fries were excellent
      and not too salty. I was a fan of the aioli, but not so much of the Thai peanut
      sauce - it seemed like it would be better on a salad or sandwich than with fries.
      Overall the food was good and the portions were just right to keep us full for
      the rest of the day.<br><br>There is street parking and lots that you can pay
      for. We ended up parking at the Tokyo mall and then going to the x-lanes after
      to play some games and get validation.

      fries, I got the chipotle aioli which was creamy and flavorful - complimented
      the fries really well. The pesto mayo was also delicious!! MUST TRY. Lastly,
      I ordered the strawberry beer which was sweet and delectable. Didn&#39;t taste

      holding that distinct duck gaminess. RABBIT &amp; PORK gives a leaner flavor
      while keeping it still well seasoned with a hint of leek. Opt for the CARAMELIZED
      ONION and SWEET PEPPERS to start before jumping onto spicy condiments. Oh, and
      the fires are mighty and filling, perfect to share with your friends!<br><br>Tables
      of well-curated mustard are available to complete your meal. The best part is
      the bar hiding in beerhall that with a sizable collection of unique brews on

      are served with its own proper, unique glass.

      to how small it is. Of all the times I have been here, it is always busy. It
      goes to show how popular and tasty their hot dogs. You are given a paper menu
      to look over your choices to order and then proceed to the cashier to make your
      order. There is usually a line and wait but it flows quickly. I believe all
      of their choices are delicious. I was disappointed in any of my orders. You
      always have two choices for toppings. After making your order, you take a number
      and follow the hallway to the dining area. There are plenty of seating. They
      bring your food out to you. There are lots of condiments to choose from which

      their dipping sauces.  It was my first time trying Belgian fries and I didn&#39;t
      know what to expect.  I recommend getting the large size so you can get 2 dipping
      sauces.  I was pleasantly in love with the pesto mayo and couldn&#39;t stop
      dipping my fries in it.  The sauce wasn&#39;t so overbearingly heavy which was
      what I liked about it.  <br><br>I&#39;m definitely getting a beer and my own
      hotdog the next time I visit here.

  - :body: Daikokuya is a great Japanese ramen joint located in the heart of Little
      Tokyo. It&#39;s roomy, hole-in-the-wall style setting will immediately set you
      back to an authentic Japanese ramen spot.  <br><br>The menu is surprisingly
      lengthy, with several different options for both ramen and rice don bowls. I
      opted to go for the ramen combination set, that comes with Japanese ramen and
      a small side item (went with their chashu fried rice).<br><br>Ramen:<br><br>I
      went for the original ramen priced at $14.50, which carried flavorful, meaty
      broth. The soup was porky and you could taste the collagen and depth of flavor
      in the broth. The noodles were alright, being a bit thicker + bouncier which
      was good to soak up the broth. However, I do prefer the thinner Hakata-Style
      noodles. <br><br>Fried Rice:<br><br>Absolutely delicious! The fried rice carries
      a charred flavor and was salty in a good way. Really flavorful and the pork
      was juicy + tender. <br><br>Great Spot.... take a look!

  - :body: '3.5 stars. Pretty good ramen, but I&#39;ve had better. <br><br>-Wait +
      Parking: <br>Came here on a Friday around 1pm and the wait was pretty quick
      (15 minutes or so with yelp check in) which was nice considering the street
      parking around this area is pretty shitty. My friend and I circled around for
      20-25 minutes before giving up and parking in one of the structures for $8.
      <br><br>-Food:<br>I had high expectations considering all the hype I had seen
      from all the yelp reviews and extremely long lines after passing by a previous
      time, but I still rate Hironori (Irvine) as the best. Comparatively speaking
      (for both their basic ramen), the noodles were around the same; thick, good
      texture. Hironori&#39;s broth just completely trumps Daikokuya from the first
      taste test, however, as it is more rich and stronger in pork flavor, while Daikokuya&#39;s
      is more of like a soy sauce/miso taste.  Daikokuya gives you less chashu in
      comparison, even though there are more pieces, they are much smaller and thinner.
      The included egg is pretty much the same, soft boiled, adds nice touch to the
      ramen. Portion sizes are also quite hefty at both places with reasonable prices
      so I give them that as well. <br><br>Service:<br>Quick and friendly. Not much
      to say here. <br><br>Overall:<br>I honestly don&#39;t think this place is worth
      the really long waits or the gas to drive all the way here and search for scarce
      parking, if you are not a local. Bottom line, I think the ramen is pretty good,
      but not good enough to outweigh everything else.'

      LOVE! We first visited The Morrison for my daughter&#39;s graduation lunch last
      June and saw that they had some great reviews on drinks and a bread pudding...
      with a what? BOURBON caramel sauce. All over that!<br><br>It&#39;s a little
      tight for little little ones (like high chair/stroller parking might be difficult),
      but my bigger little ones LOVED the food. So did I. So when I had another opportunity
      to find a local place for me and the girls after work I suggested this place
      immediately!<br><br>Happy hour is from 3pm - 7pm and the menu is wonderful with
      drinks and apps alike. The portion of the apps are HUGE. You should have seen
      the turkey burger my friend got on ciabatta bread, complete with delicious chunks
      of avocado, yum. She MADE me (arm twisting... ouch) taste the turkey patty which
      was thick and homemade looking (not a frozen patty) and OMG, super flavorful.
      Sometimes it&#39;s hard to get a turkey to taste like anything else really,
      but this was so good!<br><br>Myself and my Keto Kousin ordered the bourbon baconator
      and wings... yes we EACH ordered our own. LOL! We got side salads instead of
      fries which they happily substituted. WOW WOW WOW. The burger... juicy, flavorful
      and topped with thick slices of bacon. What is that sauce? Oh heaven juice?
      Yeah, it was that delicious even though served in a lettuce wrap. The wings
      were great, big wings, but the weenie ones you normally get that have one string
      of meat on them, served with carrots, celery and ranch. I asked for bleu cheese
      (it was watery... I was really trying to justify this, but in the end I couldn&#39;t
      and just poured in on my salad). <br><br>We had a few mixed drinks, one with
      rose vodka and lemon something... tasted like a turned up lemon drop (really
      good and tart... you know that tartness that makes you pop your tongue - POP!),
      I would have liked it a bit more floral, and perhaps if I try it again I will
      ask for that. Also, that drink was super UN-KETO. LOL! Did I drink it all. Hell-to-the-yes!<br><br>We
      were so stuffed we didn&#39;t order the famous bread pudding... so we will be
      back to get perhaps a few apps and bread pudding. Not to share. ;)<br><br>HIGHLY
      RECOMMEND! <br>~Private parking lot that is small, I would suggest carpooling
      if you can. <br>~Great black painted wall outside for pics if no one is parked
      against the wall.<br>~Free tasters of highlighted beer on tap served by lovely
      ladies on platters!

    :comment: Nachos (w/beef patty) were good - wish that underneath the top bulk
      they weren&#39;t so dry.
    :body: When it&#39;s ranked in the top 50 - must try&#39;s, you know it&#39;s
      worth a visit. I came, I saw, I&#39;m somewhat over it. <br><br>Hubby and I
      dined last week and I&#39;ll say that while I was pleased with the service overall,
      Morrison didn&#39;t overwhelm me with amazement. <br><br>The servers, bartenders

      Unfortunately, it&#39;s not one of those places that makes it on my top fav
      places to eat list. I also think it&#39;s a bit overpriced considering the food
      quality. The classic burger alone was ($14) - no sides. Nachos ($14) We also
      tried &#34;LA&#39;S Best Butterscotch Pudding&#34; ($12). I was a bit displeased
      that the server quickly asked us if a scoop of ice cream on top was fine with
      us. I saw previous photographs so I figured the small scoop was part of the
      cake. Ofc, we agreed to it and our total for the pudding cake alone totaled

      was a good amount of people (3 or 4) to have in your party if you want to try
      a little bit of a lot. <br><br>We each got a cocktail. I got the Brooklyn in
      the Summer and I think everyone liked my drink the best. I tried the other 2
      cocktails (5th + Adams, and She Knows) and I thought all three were amazing.
      <br><br>We got 2 bone marrows (because we were told by friends/family and read
      in reviews that this is amazing) and we were so happy that we did! The bone
      marrow is just so delicious in the green pasta that it comes with. Mmm I want
      some right now thinking about it!<br><br>The spaghetti with lobster, the Cavtelli
      Alla Norcini, and Nduja pizza  were also very good! But the bone marrow was
      the star. <br><br>Lastly, we topped off our meal with the chocolate tart. We
      shared it between the 3 of us and it was the perfect amount. It wasnt too sweet
      but it satafied the sweet tooth, for sure.<br><br>Gender neutral restrooms.
      <br><br>If you wanna come on the weekend, definitely try to get a reservation.
       Luckily, my friend&#39;s brother was unable to use his reservation so my friend
      invited me + my partner. I jumped at the chance to eat here on a Saturday night,
      at prime time! However, they did still make us wait like 30-40 min to be seated.
      Sounds long but other people came in without reservations and they were told
      to come back at 1030pm (in like 3+ hours).

      I am a huge fan of bread and the pate paired so nicely with the smoked bread!

  - :body: Although it is always booked up with reservations, this DTLA Arts District
      staple is a must visit spot for locals and tourists alike. From my experience
      at Bestia I can confidently say it is worth the wait and trouble of getting
      a reservation. For a Saturday night dinner reservation I booked exactly a month
      in advance and even then most of the time slots were already taken when I booked
      mine. <br><br>Based on my experience dining at Bestia I think they have some
      of the best Italian food in Los Angeles. Here&#39;s a breakdown of everything
      I got!<br><br>Food Breakdown <br><br>Mussels &amp; Clams - With their housemade
      spicy &#39;nduja sausage, fennel seed, preserved lemon, and grilled bread was
      by far my FAVORITE DISH of the night!<br><br>Spaghetti Rustichella - With dungeness
      crab, citrus, calabrian chili, thai basil, and onion seed. If you are a fan
      of crab this is for you. More of a light refreshing pasta because of the heavy
      citrus flavor. <br><br>Trofie all&#39;Amatriciana - This was my favorite pasta
      of the two. It was flavored with Italian bacon, cherry tomato, green garlic
      pistachio pesto, burnt breadcrumbs and pecorino. Great flavor combinations,
      never got tired of eating it. <br><br>Grilled Whole Branzino - Wasn&#39;t a
      fan of this dish. It may have just been an off night but the Branzino was overly
      salty in certain areas and completely lacking in seasoning in others. <br><br>Maple
      Ricotta Fritters - This was a GREAT finish to the meal! Served with a maple
      butter ganache and a sour cream &amp; huckleberry jam ice cream. The fritter
      itself was the perfect balance of fried crispiness on the outside and a light
      creamy interior.<br><br>If you are at all on the fence about coming here I suggest
      just taking the plunge and booking a reservation!

  - :body: 'I think what caused me to give Bestia 3 stars is expectation! From the
      hype all these years and the fact that I had to make reservation 2 months in
      advance, I truly was expecting to see a wow factor in every dish especially
      that we ordered some of their most famous items but unfortunately they did not
      live up to the hype. <br><br>We could not justify the price point considering
      the portion sizes, ingredients price and the level of effort to create and make
      each dish. Cherries and Tomatoes salad was $16 and was tiny with really simple
      ingredients (except the burrata) and the taste was very basic (not much skill
      set is used in it) so we could not get how it had that price. <br><br>These
      are what we got:<br><br>Antipasti: Cherries and Tomatoes - very basic<br>Pizza:
      Burrata - forgettable, we can easily pass it next time.<br>Pasti: Cavatelli
      alla Norcina - Rich and creamy with delicious sausage but not spectacular. Not
      sure why it is so popular<br>Secondi: Grilled Whole Branzino - Highlight of
      the night! Perfectly cooked very moist and tender and very well seasoned with
      basic flavors which let the fish shine. This is the only reason we will go back
      to Bestia!<br>Dolce: Bar au Chocolat Bittersweet Chocolate Budino Tart - Very
      rich with crispy and tender base, we liked it.<br><br>Service was fast and on
      point. They change the plates and utensils for every dish and also clean the
      table which was very nice. Our waitress was energetic and we talked and made
      jokes every time she checked on us. She suggested an Italian wine when we asked
      for her recommendation which was drier than my liking but surprisingly I loved
      it and was a great complement to our food. <br>She also asked if we are celebrating
      anything and after learning it is our anniversary made sure our dessert is delivered
      with a candle which always is a nice gesture. <br><br>In general we did not
      feel the food satisfied us considering the price and we definitely had better
      tasting food in less expensive places. We might come back for Branzino as it
      was truly perfect.<br><br>P.S. The 4% extra charge for employees healthcare
      is ridiculous and annoying. Cannot believe we have to pay that after paying
      for their already pricy items :/'

      at!  We ordered several of the recommendations from our server and what we saw
      from Yelp!<br><br>We ordered the Bone Marrow Pasta which was amazing!  The fatty
      marrow on perfectly cooked pasta was something I&#39;ve never tried and can&#39;t
      wait to get more.  The Gnocchi with Ricotta Cheese was also very good.  The
      gnocchi was pillow like and made perfectly.  I believe the Ricotta is made in-house
      which is a nice touch.<br><br>We also ordered the Ribeye Steak which was recommended
      to me from friend but honestly, this isn&#39;t a steak house so it was just
      OK for me.  I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again but it was good.  It just

       I don&#39;t go on the day of or month of sometimes because making reservations
      for a reasonable date/time is impossible.  <br><br>Anyway, my most recent visit
      I had some of the same things I always get and tried some things I haven&#39;t
      tried yet.<br><br>Roasted Marrow Bone (tried) - When I first had it they used
      to give two and then it went down to one and now they scrape the meat off for
      you and put it in the pasta and mix it for you.  Talk about full-service.  <br><br>Trofie
      all&#39;amatricia (new) - Slightly spicy and the bacon in it is delicious.<br><br>Roasted
      Neck Lamb (new) - This dish is huge!!!  If you are here with a table of 3 or
      more this is absolutely shareable.  There is so much meat on this thing!!  It
      is served with a side of lettuce and you kind of make your own lettuce wrap
      or taco with the meat.  The sauce that comes with it is a good mix with the
      meat.<br><br>Frozen Meyer Lemon Tartlet (new) - This item is new on the menu
      with it just being a few weeks old.  I love tart and out of all the desserts
      this was calling my name.  The top is like bruelee where it is burnt on top
      and there is scoop of lemon ice cream and the very bottom is a graham crust.
       For added decoration the dish has a slab of lemon tart on the side.  I must
      say this particular dessert/dish is what made me make my next Bestia reservation
      while still at the table.  It was so delicious and the perfect tartness to it.
       I absolutely loved the graham crust on it as well.  <br><br>Coffee (new) -
      During dinner I saw a few people get this and it really helped with how tired
      and full I was feeling from all the lamb I consumed.  Coffee is from Sumpton
      and comes with a  cube of white or brown sugar.  Just the perfect touch to go
      with the lemon tart.<br><br>I highly recommend getting the lemon tart for dessert
      and the neck lamb.  You will not be disappointed.

      off all the stops. The restaurant was crowded as usual. I had correspondence
      with the manager due to an experience at Bavel. She was very responsive and
      made our experience here an unforgettable one. First, we were given complimentary
      sparkling wine which was a very nice start to the evening. We then had the Mussels
      &amp; Clams which was made made with housemade spicy anduja sausage, fennel
      seed, preserved lemon, toasted sesame, and calabrian chili oil. It had a bit
      of a kick, but was packed full of flavor. The rustic bread that came with the
      dish was perfect to sop up the flavorful sauce. The next item was the Lobster
      Crostino with squid ink aioli, pickled chiles, opal basil, and citrus. This
      was delicious and the squid ink aioli was just right. this was another complimentary
      antipasti which we were not expecting. Next we had the Genevieve&#39;s Little
      Gems salad which had little gems, ricotta salata, soft herbs, radish and shallots.
      This salad was dressed perfectly with the walnut vinaigrette. Next, we had the
      Roasted Marrow Bone which is spinach gnoccheti, crispy breadcrumbs with aged
      balsamic. I love bone marrow and this was very good except we all thought that
      the gnoccheti was a bit overcooked and too charred. The texture of the pasta
      was a bit hard as well.<br><br>For the Paste dishes we had the Cavetelli alla
      Norcina which is ricotta dumplings, housemade pork sausage, black truffles,
      and grana padano. This was very good! However, we loved the Spaghetti Rustichella
      with dungeness crab, citrus, calabrian chili, thai basil and onion seed. This
      was delicioso!<br><br>Before we received our Secondi, they gave us another complimentary
      Charred Broccoli di Cicco made with tonnato sauce, fennel seed, squid ink breadcrumbs
      with ahi tuna mixed in. The broccoli was perfect with the sauce. For our main
      dish, we had the 32oz Bone-inDry Aged Prime Ribeye with apple balsamic and brown
      butter served with argula, radish, and tarragon. The ribeye was cooked to perfection.
      It was tender and flavorful without too much fat. 32oz was quite a lot, but
      satisfied all of us.<br><br>We were very full by then, but shared the Creme
      Fraiche Panna Cotta with gaviota strawberries, blood orange-honey syrup and
      meyer lemon cookies. The panna cotta was creamy and delicious with the syrup
      and strawberries.<br><br>The evening was my birthday celebration and I must
      say I was thoroughly satisfied. Thank you, Bestia for a wonderful evening!

      asked me to meet her here and good God almighty was this food amazing. Even
      more amazing was the wine selection. If I didn&#39;t live on the other side
      of the 110, I would definitely frequent this place more. I rarely give 5 stars
      but everything was excellent. The staff, food, music, and ambiance. Apparently
      we got there at the right time as I learned folks are on the wait list for months,
      and we were able to head straight to the bar. I&#39;m not a wait on a list kind
      of gal, but if ever in the future I&#39;m willing to do so, it would definitely
      be for here.

      staple is a must visit spot for locals and tourists alike. From my experience
      at Bestia I can confidently say it is worth the wait and trouble of getting
      a reservation. For a Saturday night dinner reservation I booked exactly a month
      in advance and even then most of the time slots were already taken when I booked
      mine. <br><br>Based on my experience dining at Bestia I think they have some

      crab, citrus, calabrian chili, thai basil, and onion seed. If you are a fan
      of crab this is for you. More of a light refreshing pasta because of the heavy
      citrus flavor. <br><br>Trofie all&#39;Amatriciana - This was my favorite pasta
      of the two. It was flavored with Italian bacon, cherry tomato, green garlic
      pistachio pesto, burnt breadcrumbs and pecorino. Great flavor combinations,

      butter ganache and a sour cream &amp; huckleberry jam ice cream. The fritter

      to Bestia!<br>Dolce: Bar au Chocolat Bittersweet Chocolate Budino Tart - Very
      rich with crispy and tender base, we liked it.<br><br>Service was fast and on
      point. They change the plates and utensils for every dish and also clean the
      table which was very nice. Our waitress was energetic and we talked and made
      jokes every time she checked on us. She suggested an Italian wine when we asked
      for her recommendation which was drier than my liking but surprisingly I loved
      it and was a great complement to our food. <br>She also asked if we are celebrating
      anything and after learning it is our anniversary made sure our dessert is delivered
      with a candle which always is a nice gesture. <br><br>In general we did not
      feel the food satisfied us considering the price and we definitely had better
      tasting food in less expensive places. We might come back for Branzino as it
      was truly perfect.<br><br>P.S. The 4% extra charge for employees healthcare
      is ridiculous and annoying. Cannot believe we have to pay that after paying
      for their already pricy items :/'

      which is a nice touch.<br><br>We also ordered the Ribeye Steak which was recommended
      to me from friend but honestly, this isn&#39;t a steak house so it was just
      OK for me.  I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again but it was good.  It just

    :body: This is my second visit to Bestia and I was not disappointed. They pulled
      off all the stops. The restaurant was crowded as usual. I had correspondence
      with the manager due to an experience at Bavel. She was very responsive and
      made our experience here an unforgettable one. First, we were given complimentary
      sparkling wine which was a very nice start to the evening. We then had the Mussels
      &amp; Clams which was made made with housemade spicy anduja sausage, fennel
      seed, preserved lemon, toasted sesame, and calabrian chili oil. It had a bit
      of a kick, but was packed full of flavor. The rustic bread that came with the
      dish was perfect to sop up the flavorful sauce. The next item was the Lobster
      Crostino with squid ink aioli, pickled chiles, opal basil, and citrus. This
      was delicious and the squid ink aioli was just right. this was another complimentary
      antipasti which we were not expecting. Next we had the Genevieve&#39;s Little
      Gems salad which had little gems, ricotta salata, soft herbs, radish and shallots.
      This salad was dressed perfectly with the walnut vinaigrette. Next, we had the
      Roasted Marrow Bone which is spinach gnoccheti, crispy breadcrumbs with aged
      balsamic. I love bone marrow and this was very good except we all thought that
      the gnoccheti was a bit overcooked and too charred. The texture of the pasta
      was a bit hard as well.<br><br>For the Paste dishes we had the Cavetelli alla
      Norcina which is ricotta dumplings, housemade pork sausage, black truffles,
      and grana padano. This was very good! However, we loved the Spaghetti Rustichella
      with dungeness crab, citrus, calabrian chili, thai basil and onion seed. This
      was delicioso!<br><br>Before we received our Secondi, they gave us another complimentary
      Charred Broccoli di Cicco made with tonnato sauce, fennel seed, squid ink breadcrumbs
      with ahi tuna mixed in. The broccoli was perfect with the sauce. For our main
      dish, we had the 32oz Bone-inDry Aged Prime Ribeye with apple balsamic and brown
      butter served with argula, radish, and tarragon. The ribeye was cooked to perfection.
      It was tender and flavorful without too much fat. 32oz was quite a lot, but
      satisfied all of us.<br><br>We were very full by then, but shared the Creme
      Fraiche Panna Cotta with gaviota strawberries, blood orange-honey syrup and
      meyer lemon cookies. The panna cotta was creamy and delicious with the syrup
      and strawberries.<br><br>The evening was my birthday celebration and I must

    :body: This is my second visit to Bestia and I was not disappointed. They pulled
      off all the stops. The restaurant was crowded as usual. I had correspondence
      with the manager due to an experience at Bavel. She was very responsive and
      made our experience here an unforgettable one. First, we were given complimentary
      sparkling wine which was a very nice start to the evening. We then had the Mussels
      &amp; Clams which was made made with housemade spicy anduja sausage, fennel
      seed, preserved lemon, toasted sesame, and calabrian chili oil. It had a bit
      of a kick, but was packed full of flavor. The rustic bread that came with the
      dish was perfect to sop up the flavorful sauce. The next item was the Lobster
      Crostino with squid ink aioli, pickled chiles, opal basil, and citrus. This
      was delicious and the squid ink aioli was just right. this was another complimentary
      antipasti which we were not expecting. Next we had the Genevieve&#39;s Little
      Gems salad which had little gems, ricotta salata, soft herbs, radish and shallots.
      This salad was dressed perfectly with the walnut vinaigrette. Next, we had the
      Roasted Marrow Bone which is spinach gnoccheti, crispy breadcrumbs with aged
      balsamic. I love bone marrow and this was very good except we all thought that
      the gnoccheti was a bit overcooked and too charred. The texture of the pasta
      was a bit hard as well.<br><br>For the Paste dishes we had the Cavetelli alla
      Norcina which is ricotta dumplings, housemade pork sausage, black truffles,
      and grana padano. This was very good! However, we loved the Spaghetti Rustichella
      with dungeness crab, citrus, calabrian chili, thai basil and onion seed. This
      was delicioso!<br><br>Before we received our Secondi, they gave us another complimentary
      Charred Broccoli di Cicco made with tonnato sauce, fennel seed, squid ink breadcrumbs
      with ahi tuna mixed in. The broccoli was perfect with the sauce. For our main
      dish, we had the 32oz Bone-inDry Aged Prime Ribeye with apple balsamic and brown

      I get chicken breast because I&#39;m picky af, and this is the most tender,
      flavorful, melt in your mouth chicken breast I&#39;ve ever had from a ramen
      place! I was shocked to be honest. I will be getting this ramen every time I&#39;m
      in DTLA if time allows.<br><br>Note that the seating is kind of bar-like, so
      you&#39;ll be either facing the windows, or sitting at the same long table as
      people you don&#39;t know. But the noise level is loud enough that it&#39;s
      not awkward but not loud enough that you have to yell.  <br><br>I suggest checking
      in on Yelp for goodies, and putting your name on the waitlist via Yelp also!

      I wish the broth came out hotter than lukewarm. The broth wasn&#39;t warm after
      putting in the veggies and began the dipping of the noodles. <br><br>Note that
      they blast EDM here!  If you&#39;re not into that during your meal than this

      <br><br>We rolled up at 630 on a Saturday and had to wait an hour for a table.
      The host said it would be about an hour after we checked in. He took a number
      down and sent a text confirming the table request. As we didn&#39;t have any
      other plans, we decided to stand outside until our name was called. We did make
      good use of our time and checker out the menu so we would be ready as soon as
      we were seated. <br><br>We decided to get the beef combo since it seemed like
      the best option for 2 people. The side dishes were already on the table when
      we sat down. <br><br>Highlights:<br>Dip with jalapeño and side of wasabi. While
      I didn&#39;t have the wasabi, that sauce was the perfect dip for the meat. <br>Prime
      rib eye - cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth like butter<br>Kimchi stew
      - paired perfectly with the rice<br>All side dishes specially the bean sprouts<br><br>The
      service was great. They have so many people working it was a bit dizzying at
      times. We didn&#39;t have to do anything though so that was a plus. Part of
      the fun with having KBBQ is getting to cook your meal. You don&#39;t get to
      do that here, but I was ok with it. <br><br>Was it worth the wait?<br>In a word,
      YES.

      The entire beef combo is freaking good. This combo comes with 3 different types
      of beef: thinly sliced beef (yummy), prime marinated beef (like bulgogi, very
      flavorful), and your choice of the prime boneless short rib or the prime rib
      eye. We chose the prime boneless short rib and it was nothing short of melt

      combo includes 3 types of pork but the one that stood out to me the most was
      the pork cheek/jowl. Guys. When this raw piece of delicacy came out, I was turned
      off by it because it looked very fatty. As our waiter cooked it, you could see
      beads of oil drilling off the grill top. But one bite later, I was in pork heaven.

      eaten. It&#39;s a definite must get for me.<br><br>The bad:<br>- Each combo
      comes with a stew. Since we ordered two combos, we tried both the beef brisket
      soybean paste stew and the kimchi stew. Both weren&#39;t anything to write home
      about. But I would not recommend the beef brisket stew, as ours turned out extremely
      salty and basically inedible.<br>- The lack of banchan. One of my favorite things
      about Korean restaurants is the banchan. Here, they only give you a small selection
      including Kim chi, pumpkin, a salad and a small pancake. This was extremely
      disappointing.<br>- They start you off with some seaweed used to wrap your meat,

      is small (maybe 12 tiny seaweed sheets the size of a matchbox) and you have
      to pay $2-3 for an extra small bag of seaweed. That&#39;s highway robbery!<br>-
      The lack of waitstaff. Out waiter was extremely nice and cooked our meats great,
      but since he had to attend to at least 4 other tables and cook all our meats,
      we had to wait and wait and wait to get his attention. They definitely need
      to hire more people. It&#39;s no wonder there&#39;s at least a one hour wait,
      it takes forever to eat!<br>- L.A. prices. Ouch. Our two combos alone cost us

  - :body: I live in San Jose, Northern California, is first time here in the area
      and was highly recommended to go to Koreatown to try the Korean BBQ which people
      say is ?better than ones from NorthCal. I chose this restaurant because it&#39;s
      the first one that came up on Yelp with the highest rating with the most reviews.
      I came and was greatly disappointed. <br><br>I ordered the Beef combo and seafood
      pancake. Meat is okay and average, not superior than any other ones I have tried
      in San Jose. The rib eye is bit chewy and unable to swallow so I spit it out.
      The side dishes are not as many as other restaurants. With the price of the
      food, I&#39;d expect to come with a bowl of rice, but no rice. Seafood pancake
      is just so so and I don&#39;t taste much seafood in it. <br><br>The service
      is okay. They BBQ for you as expected like all other Korean BBQ restaurants
      but not extraordinary. They only have one restroom each for female and male,
      and there&#39;s no place to hang or put your belongings in the female restroom.
      <br><br>When I asked to pack my leftover food to go, I asked to pack the side
      dishes as well including the lettuce and bean sprout salad that&#39;s leftover
      on my table. But the waitress says &#34;that&#39;s extra&#34;. I didn&#39;t
      quite know what she meant because I just didn&#39;t want to waste the food and
      I assume they were going to throw them away anyway so why can&#39;t I pack them
      home?!?! That&#39;s ridiculous. And I asked if I could have some sauce to go
      with my seafood pancake to go home. She basically just ignored me. I would not
      come back here nor recommend to anyone else based on this experience. I would
      gladly try other Korean BBQ places in the same areas to compare.

      seated around 8:00. We didn&#39;t park in the parking lot (was full!) but instead,
      several blocks down at a meter. <br><br>My gf and I ordered Baeksaeju (rice
      wine) and the beef combo small. The baeksaeju was sweet, and complimented the
      meat well. <br>The chadol (served 1st) was a little tough but tasted decent.
      (Both of us were fairly satiated by this point)<br>The koht deung shim (served
      2nd) was more tender and tastier. <br>Finally, the koht sahl joo mool luk (served
      3rd) was also very tender and delicious. <br><br>The service was quick, and
      the waiter cooked the meat well (nothing under cooked and just a piece or two
      burnt).<br><br>We both came in with high hopes, hearing that Kang Ho-Dong was
      top 3, if not the best, Korean bbq restaurant in LA. After eating, we both left
      feeling a little disappointed. Additional banchan costs extra. Rice wasn&#39;t
      provided and we realized after we ate, that you have to ask for it. <br><br>The
      food was (outside of the chadol) very good, but charging extra for anything
      additional, and being a Korean restaurant that doesn&#39;t automatically give
      rice, is a head scratcher. <br><br>Still, I would recommend this to anyone who

      not AYCE but you can tell that the quality of meat was exceptional. The line
      was long when we came in on a Friday night at 11pm. We waited at least an hour.
      We got the combo 1 beef small for two and it was more than enough. The kimchee
      was so good!!! All the banchans were all seriously really good and pairs with
      the meat so well. This place was just loud and you really can&#39;t here your
      partner talk to you. The food was so delicious and tasty that I even forgot
      to take a photo of the marinated short ribs! Slurped that one right up! <br>Otherwise,
      such good food!

    :body: 'With all the amazing reviews and high rating I expected a lot from Kang
      Ho-dong Baekjeong. I wasn&#39;t disappointed. Like most Korean BBQ places your
      entire party needs to be present in order to be seated. Knowing that this place
      normally has a decent line my group got there at 6:30 pm and were sat almost
      immediately. <br><br>You get the normal banchan: kimchi, salad, sprouts, and
      radish but they add seaweed, cold soup, and kimchi stew (if you so choose).
      As you can see from all the pictures the egg and cheese corn rim the grill and
      melt/warm as you cook. <br><br>If, like me, you find it difficult to decide
      what meat you want to order they have combos. A beef option and a pork option,
      both allow you to choose either small ($67, $60) or large ($110, $100) portions.
      For a group of three, we chose the large beef option and it was the perfect
      amount.  <br><br>There is valet for $5 - 2 hours max. All in all, it is a great
      spot and I will definitely go back.'

    :body: I went to 3 different places to eat KBBQ when I was in LA and this by far
      was my favourite for the quality and price of the meat !! I came here on a Monday
      at 4pm and there was no wait, when I left at 5pm there were still a lot of empty
      tables. So definitely come during off peak hour later if you don&#39;t feel
      like waiting . <br><br>The staff here is very friendly and attentive. We got
      the small beef combo for the two of us and it was more than enough. Main difference
      here is that the staff actually comes around quite often so our meat wasn&#39;t
      burnt/overcooked like other places !! Also the meat was marinated really well
      so didn&#39;t even need to dip it in the sauce. There were plenty of sides and
      it was good !!

      it looks like time has stood still. Decided to go here on a Saturday for lunch.
      There&#39;s a free validated parking lot nearby on Westlake and 7th. Score for
      free parking!!<br><br>Greeted to a belted line and friendly employee, she said
      the wait wouldn&#39;t be too long, and she was right. In line, you have swamp
      coolers in case it&#39;s a super hot day in la. My husband and I ordered a pastrami
      French dip and pastrami chili fries. We split the order, the kitchen is thoughtful
      and split it for us into two plates! I definitely recommend splitting a sandwich
      unless you&#39;re especially hungry otherwise, you&#39;ll have leftovers. I
      had coffee and we also ordered a 1/2 carafe of burgundy wine. (it&#39;s a date!)<br><br>service
      was exceptional, and although I&#39;m not the hugest fan of pastrami, this has
      gotta be the best I ever had (drake voice). I would definitely come back when

      Langers has been around since 1947 and they aren&#39;t resting on their laurels.

      <br><br>I&#39;ve had Katz deli in NY and that was both expensive and the pastrami

      Brent&#39;s, and Wexler&#39;s. While all very good Langer&#39;s is my favorite.
      <br><br>Langer&#39;s rye bread is fresh and soft (rather than harder or more
      stale bread). I imagine it is that it is double baked (according to the menu).
      Additionally, the pastrami has a fantastic balance of flavor and is also lean.
      It is excellent. <br><br>I would definitely go with the #19 (HAND-CUT HOT PASTRAMI,

    :comment: Roast beef on rye
    :body: 'It only took me 8 and a half years of living in LA... but I finally made
      it to Langer&#39;s. I&#39;m not a HUGE meat-eater so I haven&#39;t been terribly
      drawn to the pastrami and corned beef offerings, but it&#39;s an LA institution,
      so I wanted to experience it.<br><br>I was pleasantly surprised! And lucky for
      me, I was dining alone, so I didn&#39;t have to wait in line outside. I got
      seated right away at the counter -- which was quite an experience.<br><br>I
      was greeted right away by my server, Frank, AND by the gentleman sitting to
      my left. I quickly learned that this friendliness was part of the culture of
      the counter, if not the entire restaurant. <br><br>It&#39;s actually quite nice
      inside, a real family restaurant and not a deli cafeteria like I was expecting
      -- much more comfortable than Greenblatt&#39;s or Philippe&#39;s. The servers
      wear suits/tuxes and give white-tablecloth service, even when you&#39;re sitting
      at the counter.<br><br>I know the #19 is the famous sandwich at Langer&#39;s
      but I ordered what I wanted -- which was a roast beef on rye. Lemme tell you,
      it was the BEST rye I&#39;ve EVER had -- crispy, crunchy crust with a doughy
      inside and just the right amount of caraway seeds. The roast beef was tender,
      flavorful, and rare -- with a huge portion included. (I saw many folks eat half
      their sandwiches and take the other half home.) The Russian dressing was spectacular.
      <br><br>My only complaint with the sandwich was that it didn&#39;t need the
      &#34;nippy cheese&#34; (my fault for adding it) and the iceberg lettuce had
      been torn in such huge chunks that they fell out of the sandwich. But to be
      honest, I needed the sandwich to be a little less fat in order to fit it in
      my mouth, so I was OK with all of that.<br><br>The pickle on the side was DELICIOUS.
      I didn&#39;t add fries or cole slaw on the side this time, but I will next.<br><br>While
      I was eating, the proprietor Norm Langer came over to introduce himself and
      say hello, and he told me to put away my phone and just sit and enjoy the food.
      It wasn&#39;t so much an instruction as a piece of advice -- after all, phones
      are allowed, and other counter diners were using theirs. But I&#39;m glad I
      followed it, so I could absorb the atmosphere and watch the kitchen staff and
      servers at work.<br><br>I was really impressed with my server, who not only
      kept the Diet Cokes coming but was also friendly, funny, and relaxed -- the
      PICTURE of grace under pressure. There was no rush to get me out of there, despite
      the line outside. He would&#39;ve fed me another sandwich. I would&#39;ve eaten
      another one if I could&#39;ve possibly fit it in.'

      vibe, sorta neat for downtown. A short Uber ride and you&#39;ll be there. Instead
      of eating right at LA Live, I decided to venture out a bit for a little culture
      and to save from the sticker shock. After talking a seat inside, I took a look
      at the menu and was floored. Are you kidding me? Who pays $8 for soup or $20
      for a sandwich? Mind you... this isn&#39;t some crazy big, crazy good, or unique
      sandwich. It&#39;s a small, average tasting sandwich and a pitiful excuse for
      soup. I&#39;m sad to stay they got me, I paid the crazy prices and will never
      be back. Not good and extremely overpriced. Avoid!

    :body: "&#34;There&#39;s nothing more liberating than seeing the look on a New
      Yorker&#39;s face when someone says LA has the best pastrami. So we&#39;ll go
      ahead and say it again - LA has the best pastrami. And you&#39;ll find proof
      at Langer&#39;s, an LA landmark has been making the best pastrami in the world
      for over 70 years, The pièce de résistance is the #19 sandwich with pastrami,
      swiss cheese, and Russian-style coleslaw stacked between two perfect pieces
      of rye bread.&#34;<br><br>In the words of Barney Stinson, Langers is LEGENDARY.
      Langers has been around since 1947 and they aren&#39;t resting on their laurels.
      The pastrami is excellent. It is hands down my favorite in LA and in the country.
      <br><br>I&#39;ve had Katz deli in NY and that was both expensive and the pastrami
      was average at best. <br><br>In Los Angeles I have had Canter&#39;s (which is
      across the street from my high school and near and dear to my heart), Factor&#39;s,
      Brent&#39;s, and Wexler&#39;s. While all very good Langer&#39;s is my favorite.
      <br><br>Langer&#39;s rye bread is fresh and soft (rather than harder or more
      stale bread). I imagine it is that it is double baked (according to the menu).
      Additionally, the pastrami has a fantastic balance of flavor and is also lean.
      It is excellent. <br><br>I would definitely go with the #19 (HAND-CUT HOT PASTRAMI,
      COLE SLAW, RUSSIAN DRESSING, SWISS CHEESE ON DOUBLE-BAKED RYE BREAD) if you
      are visiting for the first time. <br><br>I also love their cream soda. So good.
      <br><br>The service is always top notch. The staff are so friendly and attentive.
      <br><br>I&#39;ve been going to Langer&#39;s since I was a kid and I hope that
      my kids and their kids will also go there and that Langers is around for many
      generations to come."

  - :body: WOW. JUST WOW. <br><br>Those were the exact words I uttered when I had
      my first bite of the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. I was speechless for a good
      two minutes. <br><br>I made dinner reservations for a party of two three months
      before my trip to Chicago. I heard wonderful and glorious things about this
      restaurant and knew I had to make time for this place. Our reservation was at
      4:45pm (15 minutes after their opening). Before 5pm, the restaurant was already
      packed! <br><br>My friend and I ordered the Chickpea Fritters, Goat Empanadas,
      and the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. We both paired our meal with a glass of
      wine.<br><br>The Chickpea Fritters were served with sheep&#39;s milk feta cheese
      and it all melted in my mouth so delicately. <br><br>The Goat Empanadas were
      stuffed with a pineapple-blueberry pico de gallo blend, roasted poblano crema
      and queso fresco. In every bite, there was an explosion of delightful flavors.
      <br><br>The Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face was the highlight of the meal. The pork
      had that perfect touch of crispiness on the exterior and an inside that waextraordinarily
      juicy and tender. This dish wouldn&#39;t be what it is without its crispy potato
      stix, red wine-maple syrup, and sunny side egg. <br><br>We enjoyed our meal
      so much that we decided to go for a dessert. The Mint Chocolate Semifreddo sounded
      so refreshing on a hot summer day so we shared that. It was like a watermelon
      sherbet with a sour cream whipped cream mixed in with mint chocolate chip ice
      cream. There was a lot going on in there but it all worked so well together.
      <br><br>This was truly a beautiful dining experience. To all the staff, thank
      you for your kind service (shoutout to my server who had the &#34;goat tidings
      be with you&#34; shirt) and amazing food.

      and didn&#39;t like it nearly as much as girl &amp; the goat. <br>One of my
      favorite dishes was the duck tongue! <br>Service was also good and prompt.<br>Portion
      sizes were pretty good.<br>Great place for a date night. Make sure to reserve
      in advance, some better times popped up later on and we were able to snag a
      better reservation time.

      to snag a reservation on Friday night at 9 pm. We all loved this place so much
      and were so glad we were able to eat here during our short trip. My group and
      I ordered multiple plates to share so we could all get a taste of everything.
      We ordered the seared scallops, sauteed green beans, crispy beef short ribs,
      wood oven roasted pig face, goat liver mousse, and the soft shell crab. <br><br>The
      seared scallops came with two &amp; they were cooked perfectly! Super flavorful
      and buttery soft. We were even contemplating ordering another plate of these,
      but decided to try more items. Highly recommend this!<br><br>The sauteed green
      beans were also a table favorite. It was drizzled with sauce which added a refreshing
      kick. Everything was pretty heavy so we are glad we ordered these green beans
      to cut the heaviness. Very delicious, would order this again. <br><br>The crispy
      beef short ribs, were definitely as described, crispy on the outside and soft
      on the inside. Super juicy and savory. If you want a meaty dish, you should
      definitely try this.<br><br>The wood oven roasted pig face was also good, but
      not our favorite. It was very fatty, but what can you expect. Tasted wonderful
      overall though. <br><br>The goat liver mousse came with amazing crumpets. My
      favorite combo was the pate and blueberry sauce together. Salty and sweet. <br><br>The
      soft shell crabs were a last minute order &amp; they were great. The corn that
      came with it was so good. <br><br>Everything about this place was great! From
      the service to the food to the ambiance. My friends and I had a wonderful time,
      and will be back here again the next time we visit Chicago!

  - :body: Girl &amp; the Goat is always my first stop when I come to Chicago. Reservations
      are booked very quickly, so try to plan at least 2 months in advance. Or you
      can try your luck at waiting for the bar. I&#39;ve been here a few times over
      the last couple of months, and each visit leaves me wanting more. Other than
      my recurring faves like the Goat Liver Mousse and Goat Empanadas that I get
      every time, I&#39;ve tried a few more dishes...<br><br>Some new dishes that
      I&#39;ve loved are:<br><br>Pan Roasted Halibut - My ultimate fave dish from
      GATG! Who would have thought that creamy almond butter complements halibut so
      well? I also really enjoyed the blueberries in the sauce, which sounds like
      a weird combo. Trust me, get this! <br><br>Roasted Beets - Stephanie Izard&#39;s
      rendition of caesar salad + beets! Loved the tangy avocado creme fraiche!<br><br>Marinated
      Lamb Skewers - I&#39;m not the biggest fan of lamb since it&#39;s generally
      pretty gamey, but this was delicious, albeit a little pricey for the size. Very
      tender and flavorful.<br><br>Also can&#39;t go wrong with any of the housemade
      bread selections!<br><br>Some good dishes were:<br><br>Pork, Goat &amp; Beef
      Sugo - Mafaldini pasta topped with an assortment of meat. This dish was delicious
      in the first few bites but soon became a bit too salty.<br><br>Caramel Corn
      and Malt Balls - Such a creative idea! Caramel popcorn surrounded by ice cream
      covered by a chocolate shell! <br><br>Wouldn&#39;t get again....<br><br>Kusshi
      Oysters - Yum but kinda small for the price so I wouldn&#39;t get again.

  - :body: This was my second time here, but my wife&#39;s first time since she joined
      me on my work trip to Chicago. One of the buzziest restaurants in Chicago, I
      made sure to get a reservation. The food here was excellent, nothing is overstated
      but had the right amount of flavor and contrast. <br><br>First up, I really
      liked the duck tongue. If you didn&#39;t know, duck tongue is a really expensive
      ingredient. The crisp but soft duck tongue, mixed with the crunch of the wontons,
      and the softness of the Ahi tuna, balance with citrus notes makes for a nice
      contrast of textures and flavors. I really liked this dish. <br><br>The Sweet
      corn perogis were also really good, and I recommend them as a dish. I was expecting
      a lot out of the soft shell chili crab, but it was actually just ok to me. The
      soft shell crab was overfried with batter, they use a pretty fresh soft shell
      crab and for those, you don&#39;t need to overbatter. <br><br>A slight crisp
      to taste the freshness of the soft shell crab is better, but the dish was still
      pretty good. The blueberry nuoc mam fish was also just ok to me, I didn&#39;t
      feel the blueberry tart mixed in with the salty nuoc mam very well. I also didn&#39;t
      care for the pastry chef&#39;s version of tres leches, this one was too sour
      for my taste. Overall though, an excellent meal.

      is a small plates concept with American and Spanish themes(from what I could
      tell). Also a large selection of goat items. Plates ran from $5-22. A group
      of of us split 8 plates, a cocktail each, and a bottle of wine and it came to
      about $60 each so not bad! <br><br>We tried: peppers, green beans(amazing),
      goat empanadas, shrimp, cracked wheat bread(yummy jam), short rib, grilled chicken,
      and Rangoon. Can not complain! Probably would skip the crab but it was all lovely.
      <br><br>Be sure to make a reservation and stop by when you can.'

  - :body: To prepare for our Chicago trip, my friends and I made dinner reservations
      months in advance. We flew into Chicago from Los Angeles, California for a weekend.
      We visited and ate in many spectacular restaurants in the city, and Girl and
      the Goat was my favorite!!<br><br>The restaurant is clean, hip, and beautiful.
      It&#39;s an open kitchen, so you can see the chefs and workers preparing all
      of the food. Tapas style; the restaurant serves mostly small plates to share.
      Between the 4 of us, we ordered the cracked wheat baguette, roasted cauliflower,
      wood fired octopus, the seared scallops (only 2 per plate, so order more!),
      beef short ribs, pork belly, wood oven roasted pig face (pretty much just pulled
      pork- delicious), crisp braised pork shank, and for dessert, we ordered the
      tres leches and the caramel corn &amp; malt balls. Our dinner from beginning
      to end was well executed and delicious!! Innovative &amp; creative dishes. Service
      was simply flawless throughout the night!!<br><br>I will definitely come back
      the next time I&#39;m in Chicago!!

      tender and flavorful.<br><br>Also can&#39;t go wrong with any of the housemade
      bread selections!<br><br>Some good dishes were:<br><br>Pork, Goat &amp; Beef
      Sugo - Mafaldini pasta topped with an assortment of meat. This dish was delicious
      in the first few bites but soon became a bit too salty.<br><br>Caramel Corn
      and Malt Balls - Such a creative idea! Caramel popcorn surrounded by ice cream
      covered by a chocolate shell! <br><br>Wouldn&#39;t get again....<br><br>Kusshi
      Oysters - Yum but kinda small for the price so I wouldn&#39;t get again.

    :body: This was my second time here, but my wife&#39;s first time since she joined
      me on my work trip to Chicago. One of the buzziest restaurants in Chicago, I
      made sure to get a reservation. The food here was excellent, nothing is overstated
      but had the right amount of flavor and contrast. <br><br>First up, I really
      liked the duck tongue. If you didn&#39;t know, duck tongue is a really expensive
      ingredient. The crisp but soft duck tongue, mixed with the crunch of the wontons,
      and the softness of the Ahi tuna, balance with citrus notes makes for a nice
      contrast of textures and flavors. I really liked this dish. <br><br>The Sweet
      corn perogis were also really good, and I recommend them as a dish. I was expecting
      a lot out of the soft shell chili crab, but it was actually just ok to me. The
      soft shell crab was overfried with batter, they use a pretty fresh soft shell
      crab and for those, you don&#39;t need to overbatter. <br><br>A slight crisp
      to taste the freshness of the soft shell crab is better, but the dish was still
      pretty good. The blueberry nuoc mam fish was also just ok to me, I didn&#39;t
      feel the blueberry tart mixed in with the salty nuoc mam very well. I also didn&#39;t
      care for the pastry chef&#39;s version of tres leches, this one was too sour
      for my taste. Overall though, an excellent meal.

    :body: To prepare for our Chicago trip, my friends and I made dinner reservations
      months in advance. We flew into Chicago from Los Angeles, California for a weekend.
      We visited and ate in many spectacular restaurants in the city, and Girl and
      the Goat was my favorite!!<br><br>The restaurant is clean, hip, and beautiful.
      It&#39;s an open kitchen, so you can see the chefs and workers preparing all
      of the food. Tapas style; the restaurant serves mostly small plates to share.
      Between the 4 of us, we ordered the cracked wheat baguette, roasted cauliflower,
      wood fired octopus, the seared scallops (only 2 per plate, so order more!),
      beef short ribs, pork belly, wood oven roasted pig face (pretty much just pulled
      pork- delicious), crisp braised pork shank, and for dessert, we ordered the
      tres leches and the caramel corn &amp; malt balls. Our dinner from beginning
      to end was well executed and delicious!! Innovative &amp; creative dishes. Service
      was simply flawless throughout the night!!<br><br>I will definitely come back
      the next time I&#39;m in Chicago!!

      Wildberry: our party got seated immediately and then instantly watched the wait

      was all of the gluten free items. You can get the pancakes, waffles, sandwich
      breads all made GF. Skillets and salads can be adjusted. Ultimately I was torn

      I sometimes get a gag reflex with barbacoa because I&#39;ve had some questionable
      meat cuts at Chipotle, but Wildberry was not doing me dirty like that. The meat
      was high quality and tender.<br><br>One dish that I was expecting to like but

      outside. <br><br>Anyhow YELP TIP: you can waitlist yourself (and your brunch
      bunch) in this Yelp app and basically bypass the line and check-in when you
      get the text. Boom yeah baby!!<br><br>Yes even so it appears like chaos as you
      walk up, but in reality it is a very well controlled chaos which I&#39;ll give
      them props for being able to manage the masses so well. <br><br>Once seated,
      expect to be promptly greeted by your server. If y&#39;all are lucky you&#39;ll
      get Jeremy who honestly was a standout for friendly top notch service. He has

      basic or fancy pancakes or even crapes if you&#39;d prefer!&#34; Okay, yea let&#39;s
      go for it!! (With those options, who seriously opts for plain ol&#39; toast?
      Don&#39;t do that to yourself... live a little, indulge) <br><br>From the time
      he took the order to the time fresh coffee was poured was 3-min! Juice and water
      a snap of a moment later by a runner. Every table was  at capacity or was being
      bussed pronto for the next hungry bunch. I&#39;m convinced the whole staff lives
      off octane to be able to keep that pace up all shift! <br><br>Portions were
      plentiful and of quality. Prices were very reasonable for what you get and if
      you leave hungry, you&#39;d have to be a moose because to-go boxes seemed a
      popular table offering as checks were paid. Big bonus... I was sent out with

      being so close to Millennium Park. We were told the wait would be 25-30 mins
      but it ended up being more like an hour. <br><br>Once seated we ordered fairly
      quickly. The food was really good. I ordered a jasmine ice tea and the strawberry
      lemonade and the hubs ordered the vanilla berry latte. My drinks were really
      tasty and the hubs enjoyed his latter. For entrees we ordered a Belgian Waffle
      for the little one, a specialty dish for the hubs and I ordered a create your
      own omelette. The food was really wonderful. I ordered avocado with my omelette
      which was not added in the omelette. I advised the waiter that the avocado was
      missing, which wasn&#39;t a big deal but only so I wouldn&#39;t be charged for
      the extra topping, and the waiter was really apologetic. I remember saying tot
      he hubs it wasn&#39;t such a big deal. The manager then came over to let us
      know the omelette would be comped. Truly spectacular service! <br><br>Another
      great point is that have little writing pads for kids instead of the little
      crayon and coloring sheets. I thought this was a great option because there
      was no mess.

      and I highly recommend it. It&#39;s a party in your mouth. I also tried the
      signature Berry Bliss pancakes. Those were also pretty tasty, although I wouldn&#39;t
      recommend them unless you enjoy VERY sweet breakfast items. My boyfriend ordered
      the Garden Skillet and added chorizo sausage. That was delicious. The food was
      phenomenal.<br><br>Service:<br>I have zero complaints. Everyone from the hostess,
      to the server, the the busboy was extremely friendly and helpful. Our server
      gave very good suggestions and was very pleasant. I had a wonderful experience.<br><br>This
      place is a must try when you are in Chicago.'

    :body: I came here for breakfast one morning after a recommendation from a friend
      (&amp; seeing all the great reviews). We came within an hour of closing, so
      we didn&#39;t have to wait in a huge line.<br><br>I ordered the chicken and
      waffles &amp; my fiance ordered eggs, sausage and french toast. I also got a
      strawberry lemonade, and he got an iced tea (which was swapped for orange juice
      because we forgot American&#39;s iced tea is unsweetened compared to Canadian
      iced tea!). <br><br>I am not sure the hype on this place.. perhaps just for
      the pancakes?? Our meals weren&#39;t anything special.. and costly at that too.
      My waffles didn&#39;t seem cooked through enough either..<br><br>2/5 stars because
      although the waiter was super friendly and nice, the food was mediocre at best.

      to wakeup i read breakfast reviews. With over 6000 rave reviews thought this
      was a good sign. Reading the reviews made me so hungry. <br>       I had gathered
      from the reviews  it would be crowded and could get on the waitlist from yelp.
      This was a first for me. Highly recommend doing that ... the wait was over an
      hour. <br>         Several items sounded delish .. id already decided we were
      going to share the Rutherford omelet with hashbrowns and berry bliss brioche
      french toast. Omg best breakfast ever.  I loved the French toast and i never

    :body: 'You know the scene where Indiana Jones *swoops* through the door before
      the giant boulder crushes him? I very nearly had the same experience when visiting
      Wildberry: our party got seated immediately and then instantly watched the wait
      time swell to 84 minutes in the Yelp app. Ouch!<br><br>The highlight for me
      was all of the gluten free items. You can get the pancakes, waffles, sandwich
      breads all made GF. Skillets and salads can be adjusted. Ultimately I was torn
      but caved on the Barbacoa Chilaquiles. It was savory, hearty and perfectly spiced.
      I sometimes get a gag reflex with barbacoa because I&#39;ve had some questionable
      meat cuts at Chipotle, but Wildberry was not doing me dirty like that. The meat
      was high quality and tender.<br><br>One dish that I was expecting to like but
      didn&#39;t was the cauliflower hash: it reminded me of coleslaw and I&#39;m
      a hater. You can be rest assured that Wildberry lives up to the Yelp hype. Would
      I wait 84 minutes? No. But if you can swoop in early and you&#39;re by Millennium
      Park, check it out.'

      missing, which wasn&#39;t a big deal but only so I wouldn&#39;t be charged for

  - :body: Definitely recommend going here. Trust me it is worth the wait!! On that
      note, go at an odd time, or plan to wait 3 plus hours. We put our name down
      and then went to some local bars in the area to kill time, a great way to pass
      the time!! <br><br>So note that this place is a small location! The atmosphere
      is a bit dark with some music playing. Plan to be nice and cozy!! <br><br>For
      food, being gluten free I love that this place does a real lettuce bun!! Its
      delicious and really makes up for not having a burger bun! Also, know that if
      you order a single it is actually 2 patties and a double is 3!! We didnt know

      burger. It wasn&#39;t bad by any means, it just wasn&#39;t anything special.
      It wasn&#39;t very greasy which is a plus, but it wasn&#39;t especially juicy
      or flavorful. I&#39;ve had better burgers (mostly in Texas), and I can&#39;t
      say that this is a burger that I would crave again. I especially wouldn&#39;t

      So disgusting! This was not a cool...he was not even in the kitchen, he was
      just a server. When I asked him did he eat my food he just matter of factly
      said YES with no care in the world. <br><br>I left abruptly in disgust, after
      standing outside a few minutes one of the other workers came outside to try
      to calm the situation. He said that in Chicago that it&#39;s a law that says
      it&#39;s okay to taste the patron&#39;s food. If this is true which it may be,

      burger that I&#39;ve ever had and is probably my favorite restaurant so far
      in Chicago. Wait times are exceptionally long (we waited 2+ hours during primetime
      on a Friday), but there are plenty of bars and restaurants around to pregame

      the burger is so simple (single cheeseburger w/ thick cut bacon and fried egg,
      pickle on the side) yet so heavenly! Each bite is juicy and bursting with flavor
      thanks to the peppery, caramelized savoriness of the bacon combined with double
      patties cooked to perfection, slathered in melted cheese and topped with a dripping
      yolk. <br><br>After waiting a little longer than expected for our second dish

      in flavor, in case you&#39;ve never tried or aren&#39;t the biggest fan of foie
      gras. But the eggs were moist, fluffy and delicious and when eaten on the toast,
      sufficiently balance out the extreme richness of the foie gras. <br><br>Sitting
      at the bar was fun but also kind of dangerous because I could see everything
      being tossed together by the chefs, which made it seriously tempting to order
      more dishes than we had room for because everything was so artfully prepared

      burger itself is $12.95 but you must add an egg and bacon which ends up being
      ~$18 before tax and tip. Everything is just perfect. The egg is cooked over

      on the outside but still juicy inside. The bacon also tasted a little like coffee,
      but delicious. <br><br>A single cheese burger is definitely enough food for
      1 person. A lot of people try to get the double but unless you can eat a lot
      in one sitting, get the single cheese burger with an egg and bacon. You won&#39;t

      seeing so many pics and IG posts from Au Cheval I knew I had to give this a
      try despite the horrendous wait times. To try and cheat the system, hubby and
      I came here around 9pm on July 4th. Due to the holiday and late hours, within
      20 mins we were able to grab seats right at the bar with full views of the masterminds
      behind the food. <br><br>We ordered the bone marrow, burgers and fluffy eggs.
      By our luck, I think the kitchen staff messed up someone&#39;s order and we
      were offered a fresh plate of French fries on the house. <br><br>|| Fries with
      a fried egg: 5 stars. I think this was the best part of the whole meal. It&#39;s
      not just French fries...it&#39;s honestly so much more and it&#39;s hard to
      describe other than this is an essential dish to order here. Between the sauces,
      and the crisp of the fries this was probably the best thing at Au Cheval and
      weeks later I&#39;m still remembering how amazing these were <br><br>|| Bone
      Marrow: 4.5 stars. This was also delicious, tones of bone marrow on this place.
      However the best part of this dish wasn&#39;t the bone marrow surprisingly but
      was the jam and bread that came with it. They really need to bottles the jam.
      They mix some of the delicious fat and meat from the marrow into this jam and
      after you spread it on one of their buttery thick slices of toast it&#39;s easily
      again one of the best bites in Chicago. <br><br>|| Cheeseburger: 4.5 stars.
      I hate fancy burgers. Burgers for me are simple - cheese and the patty, maybe
      some ketchup and then call it a day. That&#39;s what this burger was. Simple
      but cooked perfectly. <br><br>|| Fluffy eggs: 4 stars. I&#39;m not a huge eggs
      person to begin with but my husband is and he devoured this. This dish came
      last so were were stuffed beyond our minds at this point. But again the eggs
      were perfect and the sauce flavorful and rich. <br><br>Overall, best meal we
      had in Chicago hands down. No matter how busy they are they never skip on the
      flavor. We saw each dish being carefully examined and tested by the chef, so
      everything must be perfect before it&#39;s presented to you. This is the level

      a reputation so big, it was expected that we&#39;d have to wait, especially
      around dinner time. Our estimated wait time was 75 minutes and ended up being
      pretty exact for our party of 2 on a Monday night. This didn&#39;t bother us
      too much since we knew going in that it would be a while and they have a great
      texting system where you can put your name down and leave until your table is

      and bar seating. Once it was finally our turn to be seated, we ended up at the
      counter facing the cooks in action in the open kitchen, which was actually a
      treat! You could see each part of the burger getting made, and it added to the
      anticipation of getting your own. <br><br>We both went straight for their specialty
      and ordered single cheeseburgers - the single is actually a double cheeseburger
      with two patties and slices of cheese each. I added the egg, while the fiancé
      added both egg and bacon as well as fries. The burger comes alone with a pickle
      on the side unless you order extras. The food came out fairly quickly considering
      how busy they were but we did see how efficient they were in the kitchen from
      our seats.<br><br>I was worried that I&#39;d be let down but the burger was
      actually really delicious! I cut it in half because it was already pretty decently
      sized and besides the yolk dripping a bit, it wasn&#39;t extremely messy to
      eat and everything stayed inside. Each bite was flavorful and tasty, and I was
      surprised how quickly I was able to inhale it...and how sad I was once I had
      finished. I probably could&#39;ve eaten more at the time but did feel more full
      later in the evening, so it was still fairly satisfying on its own. My only
      minor complaint was that the second half of my burger started getting a little
      cold towards the end, but that may have been my fault from taking too many pictures
      in the beginning...<br><br>Overall, the burger was very good and was worth the
      wait and visit just to try. The price was also reasonable for the size and the
      service was friendly despite how stressful it must&#39;ve been serving so many
      people. It&#39;s probably a bit overhyped and we wouldn&#39;t wait routinely
      that long after now having had it, but I don&#39;t think it was too outrageous

    :body: 'I&#39;ve heard people say this is the best burger but I didn&#39;t believe
      it til I actually experienced it. <br><br>I had tried the burger at Small Cheval
      and wasn&#39;t that impressed. Plus, knowing that these were sister restaurants,
      I thought the burger was going to taste the same. Boy, was I wrong. <br><br>One
      evening, we were hungry and decided we were going to Au Cheval, no matter the
      wait time. We were quoted a wait of 90 mins for a table. They took my phone
      # and said they would text me once my table was ready and they would hold the
      table for 10 minutes. Fine. Challenge accepted. We went down the street for
      drinks and about an hour later, we got the text. We quickly closed our tab and
      headed over.<br><br>We ordered the &#34;single&#34; cheeseburger w bacon. The
      single actually has 2 patties and the &#34;double&#34; has 4 patties. The patties
      were juicy and flavorful and the bacon was thick and sweet. We ordered fries
      to share and they were crunchy, just the way I like &#39;em!  The aioli mayo
      that came as a dip with &#39;em took the fries up another notch. <br><br>Definitely
      the best burger I&#39;ve had so far. <br><br>Already planning a return trip
      back.'

    :comment: Single Cheeseburger with egg and bacon ~$18
    :body: Truly the best burger I ever had. My friends who took me here said every
      person they brought to try out this burger was not disappointed at all. It was
      worth the 3-4 hour wait on a Saturday night at 7PM. <br><br>The single cheese
      burger itself is $12.95 but you must add an egg and bacon which ends up being
      ~$18 before tax and tip. Everything is just perfect. The egg is cooked over
      easy, the 3 thick slabs of bacon I heard is baked and grilled so it&#39;s cripsy
      on the outside but still juicy inside. The bacon also tasted a little like coffee,
      but delicious. <br><br>A single cheese burger is definitely enough food for
      1 person. A lot of people try to get the double but unless you can eat a lot
      in one sitting, get the single cheese burger with an egg and bacon. You won&#39;t
      regret it. I will definitely try to come here every chance I get when I come
      visit Chicago.

      Farm Egg, Foie Gras &amp; Scrambled Eggs
    :body: I heard about Au Cheval&#39;s three hour wait lists and knew I had to try
      this place if I ever visited Chicago. <br><br>I made my visit to Chicago during
      the beautiful month of July and my friend and I were in luck! We went on a Sunday
      morning at 10am and we were seated in a comfortable booth right away. I ordered
      the famous single cheeseburger and he ordered the foie gras with scrambled eggs
      and toast. We also got some french fries with mornay sauce and aioli to share.
      I heard from others that the trick is to use the fried egg from the fries for
      your burger so that is exactly what I did. <br><br>Unfortunately for me, the
      burger did not live up to expectations. Everything about my meal was so salty.
      The meat patty was salty. The fries were even more. The only fortunate parts
      of it all were the fresh, large pickle that came with my burger and the fact
      that we didn&#39;t have to wait in a three hour line for a mediocre meal.

      a fried egg: 5 stars. I think this was the best part of the whole meal. It&#39;s
      not just French fries...it&#39;s honestly so much more and it&#39;s hard to
      describe other than this is an essential dish to order here. Between the sauces,
      and the crisp of the fries this was probably the best thing at Au Cheval and
      weeks later I&#39;m still remembering how amazing these were <br><br>|| Bone
      Marrow: 4.5 stars. This was also delicious, tones of bone marrow on this place.
      However the best part of this dish wasn&#39;t the bone marrow surprisingly but
      was the jam and bread that came with it. They really need to bottles the jam.
      They mix some of the delicious fat and meat from the marrow into this jam and
      after you spread it on one of their buttery thick slices of toast it&#39;s easily
      again one of the best bites in Chicago. <br><br>|| Cheeseburger: 4.5 stars.
      I hate fancy burgers. Burgers for me are simple - cheese and the patty, maybe
      some ketchup and then call it a day. That&#39;s what this burger was. Simple
      but cooked perfectly. <br><br>|| Fluffy eggs: 4 stars. I&#39;m not a huge eggs
      person to begin with but my husband is and he devoured this. This dish came
      last so were were stuffed beyond our minds at this point. But again the eggs
      were perfect and the sauce flavorful and rich. <br><br>Overall, best meal we
      had in Chicago hands down. No matter how busy they are they never skip on the
      flavor. We saw each dish being carefully examined and tested by the chef, so
      everything must be perfect before it&#39;s presented to you. This is the level
      of perfection that I love.'

      4th of July weekend. French bistros are kind of my thing at the moment and after
      seeing so many pics and IG posts from Au Cheval I knew I had to give this a
      try despite the horrendous wait times. To try and cheat the system, hubby and
      I came here around 9pm on July 4th. Due to the holiday and late hours, within
      20 mins we were able to grab seats right at the bar with full views of the masterminds
      behind the food. <br><br>We ordered the bone marrow, burgers and fluffy eggs.
      By our luck, I think the kitchen staff messed up someone&#39;s order and we
      were offered a fresh plate of French fries on the house. <br><br>|| Fries with
      a fried egg: 5 stars. I think this was the best part of the whole meal. It&#39;s
      not just French fries...it&#39;s honestly so much more and it&#39;s hard to
      describe other than this is an essential dish to order here. Between the sauces,
      and the crisp of the fries this was probably the best thing at Au Cheval and
      weeks later I&#39;m still remembering how amazing these were <br><br>|| Bone
      Marrow: 4.5 stars. This was also delicious, tones of bone marrow on this place.
      However the best part of this dish wasn&#39;t the bone marrow surprisingly but
      was the jam and bread that came with it. They really need to bottles the jam.
      They mix some of the delicious fat and meat from the marrow into this jam and
      after you spread it on one of their buttery thick slices of toast it&#39;s easily
      again one of the best bites in Chicago. <br><br>|| Cheeseburger: 4.5 stars.
      I hate fancy burgers. Burgers for me are simple - cheese and the patty, maybe
      some ketchup and then call it a day. That&#39;s what this burger was. Simple
      but cooked perfectly. <br><br>|| Fluffy eggs: 4 stars. I&#39;m not a huge eggs
      person to begin with but my husband is and he devoured this. This dish came
      last so were were stuffed beyond our minds at this point. But again the eggs
      were perfect and the sauce flavorful and rich. <br><br>Overall, best meal we
      had in Chicago hands down. No matter how busy they are they never skip on the
      flavor. We saw each dish being carefully examined and tested by the chef, so
      everything must be perfect before it&#39;s presented to you. This is the level
      of perfection that I love.'

    :comment: Single cheeseburger with egg
    :body: Touted as having one of the best burgers in the country, Au Cheval definitely
      made our list for must-try stops in Chicago, and it was a delicious stop indeed.<br><br>With
      a reputation so big, it was expected that we&#39;d have to wait, especially
      around dinner time. Our estimated wait time was 75 minutes and ended up being
      pretty exact for our party of 2 on a Monday night. This didn&#39;t bother us
      too much since we knew going in that it would be a while and they have a great
      texting system where you can put your name down and leave until your table is
      ready! <br><br>The restaurant itself has dimly lit retro bar vibes with booth
      and bar seating. Once it was finally our turn to be seated, we ended up at the
      counter facing the cooks in action in the open kitchen, which was actually a
      treat! You could see each part of the burger getting made, and it added to the
      anticipation of getting your own. <br><br>We both went straight for their specialty
      and ordered single cheeseburgers - the single is actually a double cheeseburger
      with two patties and slices of cheese each. I added the egg, while the fiancé
      added both egg and bacon as well as fries. The burger comes alone with a pickle
      on the side unless you order extras. The food came out fairly quickly considering
      how busy they were but we did see how efficient they were in the kitchen from
      our seats.<br><br>I was worried that I&#39;d be let down but the burger was
      actually really delicious! I cut it in half because it was already pretty decently
      sized and besides the yolk dripping a bit, it wasn&#39;t extremely messy to
      eat and everything stayed inside. Each bite was flavorful and tasty, and I was
      surprised how quickly I was able to inhale it...and how sad I was once I had
      finished. I probably could&#39;ve eaten more at the time but did feel more full
      later in the evening, so it was still fairly satisfying on its own. My only
      minor complaint was that the second half of my burger started getting a little
      cold towards the end, but that may have been my fault from taking too many pictures
      in the beginning...<br><br>Overall, the burger was very good and was worth the
      wait and visit just to try. The price was also reasonable for the size and the
      service was friendly despite how stressful it must&#39;ve been serving so many
      people. It&#39;s probably a bit overhyped and we wouldn&#39;t wait routinely
      that long after now having had it, but I don&#39;t think it was too outrageous
      to at least experience once while you&#39;re in the area!

      visit in a row that has been quoted at an hour wait and we&#39;ve been seated
      in less than 10 minutes. To me this is a negative because it means they don&#39;t

      great deal of upset patrons. <br><br>When it comes to the food, we ordered everything

      and well thought out. Some of them are unique creations, others are variations

      bunch of items on the menu. The top was absolutely the bone marrow... what made
      this dish stand out was not the perfectly cooked bone but the bright citrus
      and parsley side with capers and onions. It brought a wonderful brightness to
      a traditionally rich and heavy dish. <br><br>Desserts were also wonderfully
      creative and well thought out. They had many different layers of flavor but
      also texturally they were quite different and well executed. Only down side

      for exorbitant prices. Given how these plates were tapas style and meant to
      be shared, I knew the price was high. My friend and I came around 4:30 on a
      Monday, when you think the crowds would be low. But, in fact, I was wrong. The
      whole restaurant was close to packed! <br><br>We were looking for a small snack
      before dinner so we went with the fried manchego and the duck. We were in for
      a shock when the waiter brought out a HUGE plate and buns for the duck. There
      was no dinner for us that night! The 1/2 duck was a large portion definitely
      meant for 2 or more. If only I had taken a picture to show just how big it was!
      It came with hot buttery buns that you were meant to put pieces of duck and
      yogurt in. The duck itself was so tender, juicy, and flavorful. It practically
      melts in your mouth. The outside is so crispy, it likely traps all the juice
      inside. Whether you eat the duck on its own or in the bun, I guarantee that
      you will never want to stop eating it. <br><br>The fried manchego was also worth
      getting, especially as a cheaper and smaller item. The outside was very crispy
      while the inside was a melted and gooey cheese. It is placed on top of a jam
      that adds a hint of sweetness to the salty and savory cheese. <br><br>I cannot
      recommend this restaurant enough. If it weren&#39;t for the prices, I would

      is absolutely amazing and reasonably priced. The style here is small plates

      visit in a row that has been quoted at an hour wait and we&#39;ve been seated
      in less than 10 minutes. To me this is a negative because it means they don&#39;t

      Our favorite was Juliana&#39;s in BK. We had tried deep dish before but felt
      it was like eating a lasagna casserole so we ordered a thin crust pizza instead.
      <br><br>It took about 45 minutes for the pizza to come out. They must have the
      coldest oven in the world or they are super inefficient because a medium thin
      crust does not take much time at all and by that time the restaurant had already
      slowed down. <br><br>The pizza itself was pretty bad. The crust was crunchy,
      oily, and hard within a couple minutes. I remember saying &#34;I&#39;ve had
      better pizza at Pizza Hut.&#34;

      me to really figure out the best Chicago pie this time around.  The two names
      I heard most often were Lou&#39;s and Giordano&#39;s.  Lucky me, both places
      were in walking distance from my hotel.  I decided to try Lou&#39;s first, and
      boy was I impressed.<br><br>I already had some pretty high expectations of the
      place and was doing my best to not get my hopes up too high.  Walking in mid-afternoon
      on a weekday the place was already very busy.  Asked to be seated and was also
      asked for my order ahead of being seated (genius really).  Picked the classic
      and waited to be seated.  Only waited about 10 minutes and then another 25-30
      before the pizza came out.  It was fantastic, nothing showy or fancy, just simple
      ingredients that made the perfect pie.  I&#39;d say the thing that really separates
      Lou&#39;s from the other is the crust, so buttery, cooked to perfection and
      really brings everything together.  Definitely the winner here.

      do.  Based on where we were and how much time before she scooted out of town,
      we made our way to Lou Malnati&#39;s.  Funny thing is that I didn&#39;t even
      remember that this is where I&#39;d had a less than stellar pizza pie experience.
       <br><br>We got in just before the true dinner rush (thank goodness).  We were
      able to order our pizzas from the hostess stand while we waited on our table.
       Brilliant to minimize wait times on the pizza! We shared the Malnati salad
      while we waited on our pizzas.  It was delicious.  The veggies tasted fresh
      the contrast of salty salami and the bit of the gorgonzola dressing were a match
      made in heaven.  Our pizzas arrived shortly after we finished with our salad.
       It was hot and melty and exactly what my tastebuds needed!  I ordered the Malnati
      Chicago Classic (Made with Lou&#39;s lean sausage, some extra mozzarella cheese
      and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust) and added pepperoni, onions, and
      black olives.  It was the perfect combination!  The crust was flaky and truly
      buttery. It has the perfect amount of sauce and the additional toppings were
      just the right flavor combo.  <br><br>TL;DR: I&#39;m not mad at Lou Malnati&#39;s

    :body: Being a tourist in Chicago for the 3rd or 4th time it was important for
      me to really figure out the best Chicago pie this time around.  The two names
      I heard most often were Lou&#39;s and Giordano&#39;s.  Lucky me, both places
      were in walking distance from my hotel.  I decided to try Lou&#39;s first, and
      boy was I impressed.<br><br>I already had some pretty high expectations of the
      place and was doing my best to not get my hopes up too high.  Walking in mid-afternoon
      on a weekday the place was already very busy.  Asked to be seated and was also
      asked for my order ahead of being seated (genius really).  Picked the classic
      and waited to be seated.  Only waited about 10 minutes and then another 25-30
      before the pizza came out.  It was fantastic, nothing showy or fancy, just simple
      ingredients that made the perfect pie.  I&#39;d say the thing that really separates
      Lou&#39;s from the other is the crust, so buttery, cooked to perfection and
      really brings everything together.  Definitely the winner here.

      yet.  I was introduced to AIC when I studied at SAIC for post-bac work (students
      get a free memebership) and I went there quite a lot.  This was when there was
      no modern wing, so yes, years ago.  Since then I have been a paying member,
      on and off, three or so times.  That thing pays for itself!  <br><br>I&#39;ve
      lived in New York, Philadelphia, Seattle, and travelled extensively in the States
      and Europe visiting museums.  While NYC definitely has some great museums and
      Philly&#39;s PMA and NYC&#39;s MoMa/PS1 are up there among my favorite museums,
      AIC definitely comes in first.  The Hermitage experience was ruined for me due
      to the overabundance of rude tourists, and I have not been to the Louvre yet,
      but I&#39;ve otherwise been to a lot of museums in Europe.  Albertina in Vienna
      is a close second.  <br><br>Tourists do flock to this place, but not in the
      overwhelming numbers that you&#39;ll see at The Met, Hermitage, Louvre, et al.
       Summers get busy and the featured works of Hopper, Wood, Seurat, Picasso will
      have crowds around them, but there is so much to see at AIC.  Having a membership
      provides the opportunity to visit weekly if I choose; each time visiting a different
      section of the museum.  Try and visit during non-tourist seasons, or at least
      arrive early.<br><br>They have all kinds of art here as well.  You can easily
      get lost in here an entire day if you&#39;re the art lover.. there&#39;s something
      for everyone.  The temporary exhibits change up often, so you can always go
      back to see something new.  I&#39;m so happy to have a museum like this in my
      city by the lake.

      and you could easily spend an entire day there. We were there about 2.5 hours
      and got to see almost everything we&#39;d hoped to see. Because the Art Institute
      is so large and spread out (3 floors), they have many employees and volunteers
      scattered throughout to help guide you to specific exhibits, which was invaluable.
      They also have a special exhibit that highlights a particular artist, which
      was Edouard Manet when we went. Admission to this exhibit cost an extra $7 per
      ticket. They also have a cafe on the third floor. <br><br>Overall we enjoyed

      Friday so it was pretty busy, but the lines to the tickets go by fast. You have
      the option of getting the Fast Track ticket, but it costs $9 more. Otherwise
      tickets are $25 and $19 for students, really great prices for the quality and
      the variety of art. The coat check is $2 and you have to wait in the same line
      to drop off and pick up. There are two entrances to the institute and two coat
      checks, and you do need to get your tickets before you check your coats/bags.<br><br>The
      layout of the space is very confusing and somewhat frustrating- many of the
      areas are disconnected and you have to go up, down, and around to get from one
      place to the other. This is because we had specific exhibits we wanted to see,
      and skipped some things, otherwise you can probably flow better through the

      of the best collections of paintings I&#39;ve seen and personally enjoyed seeing
      all of the Monet pieces in particular. I also didn&#39;t know they had the &#34;Sunday
      afternoon on la Grande Jatte&#34; painting here so imagine my surprise when
      I randomly stumbled across it here. There were many other iconic pieces and
      exhibits here and one can easily spend a few hours walking around trying to
      see it all. Definitely worth a visit and bring comfy walking shoes!

      they will not allow you to begin. The structure was going through renovations

    :body: On a weekend getaway to Chicago, my wife and I went to the Art Institute
      of Chicago. Their collection of paintings, sculptures, textiles, etc.  is massive
      and you could easily spend an entire day there. We were there about 2.5 hours
      and got to see almost everything we&#39;d hoped to see. Because the Art Institute
      is so large and spread out (3 floors), they have many employees and volunteers
      scattered throughout to help guide you to specific exhibits, which was invaluable.
      They also have a special exhibit that highlights a particular artist, which
      was Edouard Manet when we went. Admission to this exhibit cost an extra $7 per
      ticket. They also have a cafe on the third floor. <br><br>Overall we enjoyed
      our time there, and I would recommend spending a few extra dollars to buy the
      fast pass tickets to avoid the ticket line and gain instant access into the
      Art Institute.

      tickets are $25 and $19 for students, really great prices for the quality and
      the variety of art. The coat check is $2 and you have to wait in the same line
      to drop off and pick up. There are two entrances to the institute and two coat
      checks, and you do need to get your tickets before you check your coats/bags.<br><br>The
      layout of the space is very confusing and somewhat frustrating- many of the
      areas are disconnected and you have to go up, down, and around to get from one
      place to the other. This is because we had specific exhibits we wanted to see,
      and skipped some things, otherwise you can probably flow better through the
      space. The good thing is that there are many helpful employees everywhere (some
      security and some &#34;ask me&#34;) that will help you navigate.<br><br>The
      food options are pretty abysmal for vegans. There&#39;s a cafe with pastries
      that all contain dairy, there&#39;s a fancier restaurant that can accommodate
      vegans but had a long 40 min wait (and probably high prices), and the cafeteria-where

      and the prices seem ok (the quinoa salad was a side and cost $4). I would probably
      just recommend eating somewhere else altogether. <br><br>As far as the art goes,

      rooms were the most crowded, and the miniature rooms were very cute. Pretty

      and enjoy.<br><br>All in all we had an amazing time here, we dedicated 2 hours
      which was definitely not enough, we had to rush past some of the art, and probably
      could have spent a good 4 hours here!

  - :body: 'Chef&#39;s Table, Season 1. Must eat at Pujol (done Summer 2018) and Alinea
      (done Summer 2019). So worth it.<br><br>Reservations necessary - need to be
      sure to clock in when they open. The service was knowledgeable and generally
      attentive. I felt a bit left behind after taking more time with some of the
      earlier courses, but I was never rushed. If anything, there was a long wait
      for one of the course. With that being said, I enjoyed the entire experience
      and appreciated the warm and attentive atmosphere.  The formal restaurant is
      gorgeous, with slate blue and grey tones. The art is intriguing without being
      distracting. It is everything that you can hope for in fine dining.<br><br>It
      was worth nearly $300 per person to eat here. I can&#39;t say that the wine
      pairings were necessarily worth it (one pairing is almost $200 with tax and
      tip), but the food is exquisite.<br><br>1: A white chocolate shell envelops
      a crème fraiche foam with ostera caviar. It was served with a Blanc de Blancs
      Champagne. This was an incredibly fun riff on a caviar course with a faux egg
      presentation.<br><br>2: For the salad course, it was variations on white asparagus
      with powdered jamon iberico and a savory lemon cake. There was what tasted like
      asparagus sorbet (but may have been just frozen chunked white asparagus) with
      asparagus gelee and bits of cooked white asparagus. Weird but totally delicious.
      <br><br>3: Aseries of 7 dishes that were served together and reflected the sea.
      There was Korean BBQ octopus, which just might be the best octopus that I have
      ever had. It was tender and perfectly seasoned. There was a lobster parfait,
      which had a creamy base that I think had corn and lobster topped with a bit
      of lobster and a spiced carrot puree. Delicious. The king crab was almost like
      a sushi-eque bite with a skin wrapped around a creamy crab concoction and finished
      with a bit of mango, mustard seed and micro cilantro. The shrimp bisque served
      in a giant glass prawn vessel was out of this world. It was basically the best
      curried shrimp soup ever. The fried chicken skin coated in lime powder with
      a bit of peanut was the most incongruous of the group but no less delicious.
      There was a refreshing preparation of julienned big fin squid and raw coconut
      in a tangy vinaigrette with micro greens. To finish, there was a basil sorbet
      atop a tropical rambutan gelee with a piece of basil on top. The pairing was
      an off-dry Riesling from Von Hovel.<br><br>Next up, we had a trip to the kitchen
      for a little meat stuffed croquette topped with mole negro and Amarillo. It
      was served with their version red bell pepper mezcalrita.<br><br>4: A bowl was
      set at the table and lit on fire. While watching the fire burn, we were served
      with this gorgeous goat butter acorn foam that was topped with little oxalis
      leaves and minced mushrooms. The piece de resistance was the accompanying &#34;rye
      bread&#34; stuffed morel mushrooms. Two huge morel mushrooms were filled with
      this dark brown cream that tasted like the best rye pumpernickel bread ever.
      Excellent with the Domaine Dominique Mugneret Burgundy (2012).  The fire was
      extinguished with a branch of rosemary and topped with two crackers topped with
      minced mushrooms and the prettiest little flowers.<br><br>5: Another series
      of bites. You were to start with the rabbit loin that was sauced (BBQ) and came
      to the table on lit charcoal. It was the incredibly tender and not at all gamey.
      Next up, I had the delightful rabbit foam with heirloom beans. Then, I moved
      onto the cracker, which was seasoned with sumac and topped with a rabbit-celery
      root mixture that was finished with chervil dust. My final bite was what would
      best be described as a rabbit liver truffle.<br><br>6: For our 6th course, we
      had my favorite wine of the night - a 2002 Lebanese CInsalt blend from Chateau
      Musar. It was served with a slice of wagyu beef that was carved tableside and
      served with this luxurious and delicious foie gras sauce, shavings of black
      truffle, sautéed woodear mushrooms and truffle puree.<br><br>7: The pairing
      for our final course was a Tepextate Mezcal from Cruz de Fuego in Oaxaca. It
      was brilliant with dessert, which was basically a tamarind pudding dusted with
      cocoa and topped with crunchies, whipped cream and a candied hoja santa leaf.
      There was also a sweet, clear drink that was served alongside, which was almost
      like a clarified rice beverage. <br><br>The conclusion of the meal is the restaurant&#39;s
      signature green apple balloon which is so much fun and surprisingly delicious.
      They brought us each a birthday candle as we were celebrating our summer birthdays.
      Then, we finished with a little 2007 Oremus Tokaji Aszu, which was full bodied
      and had just the right amount of sweet to finish a gorgeous meal.<br><br>Alinea
      was so worth it. (And writing a longer review and abbreviating it for Yelp was
      also worth it - the experience was incredible.)'

      to say nothing and let other unsuspecting schmucks waste their money on this
      sham of a meal. As my husband put it, &#34;Instead of getting dinner, it was
      like going to a magic show and Gob Bluth was the magician.&#34;<br><br>We really
      thought it was going to be cool when we sat down. It smelled of oranges, people
      around us were finishing their meals with sugar balloons (cool!) and then we
      sat there for a solid half hour before we received anything to eat. It was like
      that all night - we were so hungry by the time they brought out each scant course
      we devoured everything immediately - regardless of what it felt, smelled, or
      tasted like...which overall, wasn&#39;t much.<br><br>The first course was a
      creamy substance and probably the best caviar I&#39;ll ever eat in my life.
      I was sorely disappointed to find it had been overwhelmed with smoke, and the
      whole dish tasted of a campfire. Why? Why would you DO that to good caviar?<br><br>We
      took a trip to the kitchen to watch a machine do what two bartenders manage
      on the reg - shaking four cocktails at once - WOW! We then ate what my husband
      described as &#34;The most expensive combo on earth,&#34; and I found to be
      a small, pizza flavored cracker. OK.<br><br>One of the best bites (and it was
      about the size of one bite, but I cut it in two just to make it feel like I
      was eating a meal) was the squid. It was a little chewy, but one of the only
      things I got the chew in earnest all evening.<br><br>Two of the biggest insults
      of the evening were the &#34;Langoustine paper&#34; (the skin that forms on
      top of gravy that&#39;s sat out too long) in &#34;bouillabaisse&#34; (salty
      ramen broth), and what they called &#34;chowder&#34;. After a table-side show
      of digging a potato out of a formerly burning bowl of salt and mashing it dramatically
      with herbs and what might have been a tasty aioli, they took a whipped cream
      charger and regurgitated cold, sad, whipped &#34;chowder&#34; all over that
      beautiful mashed, herbed potato. Biggest disappointment of the night.<br><br>I&#39;ll
      end this here, but suffice it to say dessert was equally unsatisfying (white
      chocolate shell with a finger&#39;s worth of chocolate and banana pudding on
      a giant plate.)<br><br>We walked in expecting memories that would last a lifetime.
      In that regard, we got exactly what we paid for: the prettiest/worst meal of
      our trip to Chicago. We will not return.'

  - :body: Go for the experience, not the food. The service and the food journey of
      Alinea is really something I think you should do once, but the food itself ranges
      in tastiness. Honestly, to me, most of them were bad, a couple were ok, and
      one was amazing. But for $270 per person? No thank you.<br><br>I&#39;m not going
      to go into real specifics, but I will start by saying that if you plan to come
      here, you have to walk in with a VERY OPEN MIND. If you&#39;re a picky eater
      or don&#39;t like certain things or always order the same dish at every restaurant,
      do not come here. Alinea is an experimental restaurant that prides itself on
      innovation.<br><br>To start, the servers were all incredibly nice and knowledgeable.
      I had enjoyable conversations with every single one of them. In addition, my
      stay wasn&#39;t just plate after plate of food. There were shows, demonstrations,
      and new and innovative ways to eat. All of this really made this experience
      feel truly unique.<br><br>However, there is one problem. At the end of the day,
      what matters most is the food. And the food on average here is honestly below
      average, especially considering how expensive it is to eat here. I honestly
      think people pay more for the experience than the actual food. To make matters
      more awkward, since it&#39;s a set menu, most of the food is pre-prepared far
      far in advance so it&#39;s likely not as fresh as other places.<br><br>The first
      couple dishes were very small, yet I still had a tough time finishing them because
      of the taste. The first couple dishes really focused on some weird trope of
      tasting sour and a bit rancid and my stomach couldn&#39;t take it.<br><br>Some
      dishes were good like the A-5 wagyu, but sadly they were overshadowed by the
      greater proportion of bad dishes. If I had to give my honest advice, I would
      say that I respect Alinea for its desire to branch from the norm, but I&#39;d
      rather eat at a restaurant that focuses on the quality of their food.

  - :body: What can a person say about Alinea that hasn&#39;t been said before? <br><br>It&#39;s
      a top restaurant in the world with 3 Michelin stars and numerous other accolades.
      <br><br>And it&#39;s expensive. <br><br>Bookings can be made on the 15th of
      the month, 2 months before you&#39;re trying to go (released at 11AM Central
      time). These things go FAST. So be prepared, make yourself a Tock account beforehand
      and keep hitting F5 until you get what you&#39;re looking for. All the reservations
      for the date I was aiming for were gone within 3 minutes. But also - prepare
      your wallet. You&#39;ll be charged automatically, complete with 20% service
      charge and sales tax. So the $200ish meal you were aiming for easily becomes
      $350.<br><br>Nevertheless, Alinea is an experience. It&#39;s not just food -
      it&#39;s fun, it&#39;s witty and it&#39;s a bucket list item. <br><br>I don&#39;t
      want to go into too much of what we had - but there were dishes we loved, dishes
      that were meh and dishes that we didn&#39;t really like. But that&#39;s what
      happens when you do a tasting menu. I will say every course we got was very
      unique and there are definitely ones that stood us to me as extremely memorable.
      If you get the chance to dine here, it&#39;s worth it just for the experience.
      <br><br>One of the best parts of the meal was going to the kitchen. It was awesome
      to watch all these masters at work and to get an inside glimpse of what was
      going on. <br><br>And you can ask for things like apple cider or sparkling water
      (all included). If I had to do it all over again, I&#39;d opt for an early time.
      That way you won&#39;t be &#34;spoiled&#34; by seeing what is happening at other
      tables. <br><br>Oh and there&#39;s some things you&#39;re not suppose to eat...for
      example, there was a garlic bulb that was presented with our beef dish. Being
      garlic lovers, we kept trying to dig at it and a server promptly took it away.
      Whoops, haha.

  - :body: So I came to Chicago for a work conference, and it was my first time coming
      to a Michelin Star city, so I decided to go whole hog and come right to this
      three star place that I saw on a Netflix docuseries. It was actually recently
      named the 37th best restaurant in the entire world, and I know why. Eating at
      Alinea is like being part of art. The menu plays with all of your senses and
      gives you an incredible experience that keeps you guessing. <br><br>There are
      10 courses and a special trip down into the kitchen so you can see the well
      oiled machine that is all the chefs working on all of the different courses
      simultaneously. While you&#39;re going that, one of the chefs is making a bell
      pepper flavored cocktail for everyone and talking about the restaurant a little
      bit. <br><br>Back to the main courses. I experienced a food item that looked
      like a rock but was filled with caviar, noodles that were made out of scallops,
      liquid nitrogen that was poured into a bowl of coconuts and limes to get a complimentary
      aroma for our course, the best cooked octopus I&#39;ve ever had in my life,
      and a puree that was inside of a fried mushroom that had the exact flavor of
      toast. It was wild, and it was all delicious. <br><br>I also got some top-notch
      pork that had been cooking in front of me for a while, an bite of food that
      was made out of the same acorns those pigs would have eaten in the wild, and
      a piece of wagyu steak. It was so, so good. It was served with a puree that
      tasted like french fries. I kid you not. <br><br>Then came the three dessert
      courses. A server dug into a bowl of salt that was the cooking medium for my
      pork dish and pulled out a yam that had also been cooking in front of me the
      entire time. He cut of that yam and added some mix-ins and served me a delicious
      yam dessert dish. Also, there was an ice cream dish with sipping cocoa, a chocolate
      ball that exploded with salted caramel liquid, and the famous balloon. The sugar
      balloon that was filled with helium and given to me on an edible rope. Too cool.
      <br><br>This was an experience I will never forget. The combination of the flavor
      and the experience and the disorientation of my senses makes me wish I could
      give this place six stars. I am thoroughly impressed and I can say that if I
      ever make it back to Chicago, I will stop by again.

    :body: 'Chef&#39;s Table, Season 1. Must eat at Pujol (done Summer 2018) and Alinea
      (done Summer 2019). So worth it.<br><br>Reservations necessary - need to be
      sure to clock in when they open. The service was knowledgeable and generally
      attentive. I felt a bit left behind after taking more time with some of the
      earlier courses, but I was never rushed. If anything, there was a long wait
      for one of the course. With that being said, I enjoyed the entire experience
      and appreciated the warm and attentive atmosphere.  The formal restaurant is
      gorgeous, with slate blue and grey tones. The art is intriguing without being
      distracting. It is everything that you can hope for in fine dining.<br><br>It
      was worth nearly $300 per person to eat here. I can&#39;t say that the wine
      pairings were necessarily worth it (one pairing is almost $200 with tax and
      tip), but the food is exquisite.<br><br>1: A white chocolate shell envelops
      a crème fraiche foam with ostera caviar. It was served with a Blanc de Blancs
      Champagne. This was an incredibly fun riff on a caviar course with a faux egg
      presentation.<br><br>2: For the salad course, it was variations on white asparagus
      with powdered jamon iberico and a savory lemon cake. There was what tasted like
      asparagus sorbet (but may have been just frozen chunked white asparagus) with
      asparagus gelee and bits of cooked white asparagus. Weird but totally delicious.
      <br><br>3: Aseries of 7 dishes that were served together and reflected the sea.
      There was Korean BBQ octopus, which just might be the best octopus that I have
      ever had. It was tender and perfectly seasoned. There was a lobster parfait,
      which had a creamy base that I think had corn and lobster topped with a bit
      of lobster and a spiced carrot puree. Delicious. The king crab was almost like
      a sushi-eque bite with a skin wrapped around a creamy crab concoction and finished
      with a bit of mango, mustard seed and micro cilantro. The shrimp bisque served
      in a giant glass prawn vessel was out of this world. It was basically the best
      curried shrimp soup ever. The fried chicken skin coated in lime powder with
      a bit of peanut was the most incongruous of the group but no less delicious.
      There was a refreshing preparation of julienned big fin squid and raw coconut
      in a tangy vinaigrette with micro greens. To finish, there was a basil sorbet
      atop a tropical rambutan gelee with a piece of basil on top. The pairing was
      an off-dry Riesling from Von Hovel.<br><br>Next up, we had a trip to the kitchen
      for a little meat stuffed croquette topped with mole negro and Amarillo. It
      was served with their version red bell pepper mezcalrita.<br><br>4: A bowl was
      set at the table and lit on fire. While watching the fire burn, we were served
      with this gorgeous goat butter acorn foam that was topped with little oxalis
      leaves and minced mushrooms. The piece de resistance was the accompanying &#34;rye
      bread&#34; stuffed morel mushrooms. Two huge morel mushrooms were filled with
      this dark brown cream that tasted like the best rye pumpernickel bread ever.
      Excellent with the Domaine Dominique Mugneret Burgundy (2012).  The fire was
      extinguished with a branch of rosemary and topped with two crackers topped with
      minced mushrooms and the prettiest little flowers.<br><br>5: Another series
      of bites. You were to start with the rabbit loin that was sauced (BBQ) and came
      to the table on lit charcoal. It was the incredibly tender and not at all gamey.
      Next up, I had the delightful rabbit foam with heirloom beans. Then, I moved
      onto the cracker, which was seasoned with sumac and topped with a rabbit-celery
      root mixture that was finished with chervil dust. My final bite was what would
      best be described as a rabbit liver truffle.<br><br>6: For our 6th course, we
      had my favorite wine of the night - a 2002 Lebanese CInsalt blend from Chateau
      Musar. It was served with a slice of wagyu beef that was carved tableside and
      served with this luxurious and delicious foie gras sauce, shavings of black
      truffle, sautéed woodear mushrooms and truffle puree.<br><br>7: The pairing

      tables. <br><br>Oh and there&#39;s some things you&#39;re not suppose to eat...for

      Whoops, haha.

    :body: So I came to Chicago for a work conference, and it was my first time coming
      to a Michelin Star city, so I decided to go whole hog and come right to this
      three star place that I saw on a Netflix docuseries. It was actually recently
      named the 37th best restaurant in the entire world, and I know why. Eating at
      Alinea is like being part of art. The menu plays with all of your senses and
      gives you an incredible experience that keeps you guessing. <br><br>There are
      10 courses and a special trip down into the kitchen so you can see the well
      oiled machine that is all the chefs working on all of the different courses
      simultaneously. While you&#39;re going that, one of the chefs is making a bell
      pepper flavored cocktail for everyone and talking about the restaurant a little
      bit. <br><br>Back to the main courses. I experienced a food item that looked
      like a rock but was filled with caviar, noodles that were made out of scallops,
      liquid nitrogen that was poured into a bowl of coconuts and limes to get a complimentary
      aroma for our course, the best cooked octopus I&#39;ve ever had in my life,
      and a puree that was inside of a fried mushroom that had the exact flavor of
      toast. It was wild, and it was all delicious. <br><br>I also got some top-notch
      pork that had been cooking in front of me for a while, an bite of food that
      was made out of the same acorns those pigs would have eaten in the wild, and
      a piece of wagyu steak. It was so, so good. It was served with a puree that
      tasted like french fries. I kid you not. <br><br>Then came the three dessert
      courses. A server dug into a bowl of salt that was the cooking medium for my
      pork dish and pulled out a yam that had also been cooking in front of me the
      entire time. He cut of that yam and added some mix-ins and served me a delicious
      yam dessert dish. Also, there was an ice cream dish with sipping cocoa, a chocolate
      ball that exploded with salted caramel liquid, and the famous balloon. The sugar
      balloon that was filled with helium and given to me on an edible rope. Too cool.
      <br><br>This was an experience I will never forget. The combination of the flavor
      and the experience and the disorientation of my senses makes me wish I could
      give this place six stars. I am thoroughly impressed and I can say that if I
      ever make it back to Chicago, I will stop by again.

      basically took the rental car and drove all the way to downtown Houston right
      before the Breakfast Klub&#39;s opening time at 8 AM. Parking was pretty easy
      because the restaurant has a small lot right in front of the restaurant and
      the restaurant wasn&#39;t crowded at 8 AM, but parking can get tough in this
      area during the busy dining hours.<br><br>The owner of the Breakfast Klub (TBK)
      is Marcus Davis and he is the  host of the weekly radio show &#34;Sunday Morning
      Live&#34; on Radio One&#39;s KMJQ 102 FM. TBK focuses on Southern food and their
      signature dishes are chicken waffle and catfish. In fact those are the only
      two dishes with special &#34;signature items&#34; designations on the menu.<br><br>***<br><br>Katfish
      plate (seasoned katfish fillet and grits served with potatoes or 2 eggs and
      choice of toast or biskit - picked sunny side up &amp; biscuit for $14.99; also
      had grits with cheese for extra $0.55): Honestly grits didn&#39;t taste too
      bad, but I have never been a big fan of grits because they always tasted pretty
      bland. In fact I regretted paying extra $0.55 for grits with cheese. However,
      that catfish completely blew me out of the water and I totally see why this
      restaurant got such a rave review. Not only did Catfish have a super crispy
      texture, but meat was also soft, moist, and savory all at the same time! I did
      see many other customers ordered chicken and waffle, but I did NOT regret getting
      this catfish. Not too impressed with the biscuit - tasted cold and hard.<br><br>Kafe
      Latte ($4.99): Please don&#39;t expect this latte to be the type of latte you
      get in a coffee specialty shop. Coffee flavor was there, but the drink tasted
      like one of those lattes you get at automatic espresso machines - too much foams
      and latte tasted a bit watery. With that being said, the drink itself wasn&#39;t
      all that bad and I just think $4.99 doesn&#39;t really justify its so-so quality.<br><br>***<br><br>Yes
      catfish was a 5-star worthy dish and I think it is absolutely a MUST TRY dish
      in Houston, but I rounded down to 4-star because everything else (grits, biscuit,
      and latte) other than catfish was pretty mediocre.'

      about this place, we decided to give this place a try before hitting the road
      home. Upon arriving I was a bit confuse as to where the building was. It could
      use some outer renovation. The sign was a faded color. It had me feeling a little
      skeptical at first but once I step foot into the door I felt like I was back
      at home in New Orleans. The hostess was friendly and just had this warm welcoming
      feel. She explain to us how the service works. You order at the counter and
      they give you a number to place on your table. Self serve drinks. <br><br>The
      chicken and waffle are the best I had. Especially the chicken. I&#39;m so glad
      they were wings and drums vs breast. The wings had a nice crunch to it while
      the inside was moist. It had a slight spicy kick to it. Perfectly season. The
      waffle was fluffy and gave the right amount of sweet and savory to the dish.
      <br><br>My boyfriend ordered a croissant sandwich with potatoes. He devoured
      the sandwich but didn&#39;t care too much for the potatoes. It was a bit mushy
      and we like them crispy. <br><br>The parking lot is tiny in the front. There&#39;s
      also additional parking across the street. It can get overcrowded so my best
      option would be just to pay for street parking. <br><br>Next time we are back
      in Houston, I would like to try their catfish and grits!

    :comment: Wings and waffle
    :body: 'This is my absolute favorite place for chicken and waffles. I&#39;ve been
      here several times over the last few years and it has never disappointed!! An
      absolute gem for brunch food.<br><br>Ambiance: 5/5. Very cozy, home feel. Not
      your typical bright, insta-backdrop brunch setting. It&#39;s more of a hole-in-the-wall
      vibe and you just know you&#39;re about to get some good soul food.<br><br>Service:
      6/5. Yes, better than 5/5. The staff was super friendly though they definitely
      moved quickly which may come off as rushing to some, but it was definitely understandable
      considering the long line that goes out the door and wraps around the side of
      the building. We came with a giant party of 11 and they were totally accommodating
      and seated us pretty quickly after we ordered at the counter. The staff would
      constantly check back in with us to let us know the status of our table so we
      knew we were top priority to them. After we left our table, the owner himself
      even came to our group outside the restaurant to ask about our experience. Loved
      the service!!<br><br>Food: 5/5. Like I said before, their wings and waffle just
      can&#39;t be beat. One of my friends was never a believer in chicken n waffles
      and she ordered it here, and now she&#39;s a believer. A must try!!!<br><br>Overall,
      the experience here is totally worth the wait in the line that goes out the
      door. Definitely a huge fan!'

      Lines are long, but they move quick. Staff was friendly and food arrives almost
      as soon as you sit down. The food was ready extremely quick (major plus)! Menus
      given to you as you wait in line so you can order as soon as you get to the
      register. Most efficient restaurant I been too in awhile. <br><br>The staff,
      including the owner are friendly and accessible, and seem genuinely interested
      in making sure you&#39;re having a good time.<br><br>The food servings are very
      generous so we all needed to go plates. Everything is self service (coffee,
      utensils, fountain drinks, condiments, etc.).<br><br> Feels like you&#39;re
      having a home cooked breakfast as a guest in their home.<br><br>Will definitely
      be back and was well worth the trip. When I&#39;m in Houston will make sure
      I stop by every chance I can get. <br><br>Way to go Breaking Club!

      was flaky on the outside and moist on the inside. The eggs were fresh and whipped
      to perfection. The biscuit was soft and fluffy.<br><br>To top off the excellent
      food the service by the wonderful ladies was exceptional. I see why this place
      gets such great reviews. <br><br>If you are in Houston this is a MUST!!<br><br>Breakfast
      Klub is outstanding

    :body: I&#39;ve been craving for chicken and waffle so after many recommendations
      about this place, we decided to give this place a try before hitting the road
      home. Upon arriving I was a bit confuse as to where the building was. It could
      use some outer renovation. The sign was a faded color. It had me feeling a little
      skeptical at first but once I step foot into the door I felt like I was back
      at home in New Orleans. The hostess was friendly and just had this warm welcoming
      feel. She explain to us how the service works. You order at the counter and
      they give you a number to place on your table. Self serve drinks. <br><br>The
      chicken and waffle are the best I had. Especially the chicken. I&#39;m so glad
      they were wings and drums vs breast. The wings had a nice crunch to it while
      the inside was moist. It had a slight spicy kick to it. Perfectly season. The
      waffle was fluffy and gave the right amount of sweet and savory to the dish.
      <br><br>My boyfriend ordered a croissant sandwich with potatoes. He devoured
      the sandwich but didn&#39;t care too much for the potatoes. It was a bit mushy
      and we like them crispy. <br><br>The parking lot is tiny in the front. There&#39;s
      also additional parking across the street. It can get overcrowded so my best
      option would be just to pay for street parking. <br><br>Next time we are back
      in Houston, I would like to try their catfish and grits!

      the atmosphere is lively. <br>Lately I&#39;ve been obsessed with the Sprouting
      Up bowl that has a good portion of crispy Brussels added. I love the thick curly

      sitting at the bar though, you can see the highly rated sushi chefs preparing

      I like to see before I order so if I see something appealing I always ask &#34;what
      is that and can we get 2!&#34; <br>Also if it is your first time know that you
      do not need soy sauce and wasabi that the sushi chef already seasoned your fish
      with certain flavors that the chef thinks pairs best with that fish... then
      you eat it by putting the fish on the tongue first not the rice. If this is
      your first time and you are new the waiters willl help you. <br>You can also

      a lot of their specialty dishes. I believe that the size of everything is just
      cut in half, but it&#39;s great because you get to try more items this way.
      Also, a bottle of sake during this time is only $3, which resulted in me forgetting

  - :body: 'TL;DR: Contemporary Japanese Fare with unique and classic dishes at a
      high price point. Definitely come during the Sake Social for very affordable
      small plates and drinks. <br><br>Uchi has long since made a name for itself
      in Houston as one of the most  (if not the most) well known resturants for high-end
      Japanese cuisine. Coming with a party of 10 people during my first visit, I
      was able to sample a large variety of the dishes and small plates, in addition
      to some of the nigiri, rolls, and desserts. Though I can attest that Uchi provides
      food and service distinctly better than the average Japanese place in Houston,
      I do think there are other Japanese resturants where your money would be better
      spent. <br><br>First of all, I would reccomend coming here during happy hour,
      or &#34;Sake Social&#34; (which runs 5-7 pm) , and only during happy hour. Uchi&#39;s
      menu is comprised of both cold and hot tastings, in addition to nigiri, rolls,
      and seasonal specials, but without the Sake Social, you&#39;ll easily spend
      70 to 80+ (unless you do one of the set courses) to leave satisfied. The Sake
      Social menu includes a pretty large variety of smaller versions of the standard
      menu items at a very reasonable price. Ordering mostly off of the Happy Hour
      menu and a few select things from the standard menu will ensure you have a filling,
      delicious, and not overly pricey experience. <br><br>Some of the stand out happy
      hour dishes included the 72 hour short rib, the walu walu, and the sake kiwi.
      The 72 hour short rib (social short rib on Sake Social menu), though a small
      portion, is very well executed dish, composed of a delicious, slightly spicy
      sauce, with lotus root and a peanut garnish adorning some very tender cubes
      of short rib. Together, it makes for a great textural and flavorful experience.
      The sake kiwi could have used a touch of salt, but it was a great deal at only
      $6 for a solid portion of salmon, and definitely made for a tasty few bites.
      The walu walu, a oak grilled piece of escolar in a flavorful sauce, was a unique
      dish that changed my previously negative perception of escolar. I would highly
      reccomend trying almost everything from the Sake Social menu that sounds or
      looks good to you.<br><br>A dish that fell short (very short) of expectations
      was the hot rock beef. Though it might make for a great Instagram pic or addition
      to your snapchat story, don&#39;t expect much else. For $17.50, you&#39;ll recieve
      5 small pieces of &#34;wagyu&#34; that taste like average sirloin, accompanied
      by a simple ponzu dipping sauce. It&#39;s by no means bad-tasting, but I&#39;d
      reccomend spending that money on a few sirloins at HEB, or at least any other
      dish on the menu. <br><br>Rolls here are nothing too special, but the ones on
      the Sake Social menu are a pretty great deal, and are good to fill you up. The
      &#34;ham and eggs&#34;, a pork belly roll served with a mustard dipping sauce,
      off of the standard menu is a little pricey, but a pretty unique and delicious
      roll worth trying at least once. I also got to sample both the dayboat scallop
      and foie gras nigiri; both were some of the most delicious bites of the entire
      dinner. Though nigiri here are a tad small, splurging for the foie piece is
      definitely worth it if you can afford it. <br><br>Uchi&#39;s Desserts are as
      expected from any high end resturant. I tried the foie gras candy bar and fried
      milk, and can definitely only reccomend the latter. The foie gras candy bar,
      while not bad, is akin to an icecream bar with a layer of cake on the bottom
      (maybe slightly reminicient of foie if you try really hard to recall the taste
      when biting into it). The fried milk is more unique, and has several components
      including a delicious salted fudge and fried condensed milk balls that all work
      well together for a few delicious final bites to your meal. <br><br>I would
      be remiss if I didn&#39;t say a word about the service at Uchi, which was excellent.
      Coordinating with a planner to reserve a table for 10 was quite easy, and our
      servers were very attentive and helpful. During happy hour, items are definitely
      a little slow to come out, though, so order early rather than adding items as
      you go.<br><br>Dinner at Uchi is definitely an enjoyable, delicious, and pricey
      experience. Though at a resturant like Uchi, it&#39;s expected to spend quite
      a bit, I can&#39;t say the food was good enough to warrant comnig back for the
      regularly priced menu. I am curious about their omakase and other fixed menus,
      but outside of the Sake Social, I wouldn&#39;t reccomend Uchi for the price.
      However, I am eager to return in the future and sample more of their menu. 4

      My friend Christina raves about this place and tells me it&#39;s hands-down
      one of her favorite (if not her favorite) Japanese restaurants in all of Houston.
      It lived up to the hype and it was beautiful.<br><br>No surprise, but I recommend
      reservations. This place is permanently packed from open to close. It&#39;s
      a moderate size restaurant and would be perfect for any date night. It&#39;s
      loud, but it&#39;s cozy enough to be intimate. We got a reservation and sat
      at the sushi bar. I think this allows for the best experience. You are thrown
      into the proverbial trenches with the sushi chefs and you get to watch them
      masterfully work their craft. The chefs are friendly, helpful, entertaining,
      and such a joy to interact with.<br><br>You can look at the pictures I posted
      to get an idea of what kind of food you can expect. Don&#39;t come here expecting
      California rolls or sweet and sticky rolls drenched in sauces. This is classic
      and clean high-end sushi with a nice neo-modern twist. Most of your senses will
      be delighted with the different savory to sweet profiles.<br><br>Some of my
      favorites were the salmon belly, yellow tail everything, and really just ask
      the chefs for recommendations. They won&#39;t let you down as everything tasted
      like a new experience. The thing I DIE FOR is the foie gras. GOOD. GOD. It was
      a culinary orgasmic experience. I&#39;ve never tasted anything so sweet, juicy,
      succulent, savory, that offered this beautifully light crisp on the outside
      while maintaining a buttery-melt-in-your-mouth finish. It is unreal. You could
      have it for dessert honestly. The ACTUAL dessert of fried milk is really good.
      It&#39;s condensed milk fried in a doughnut like casing served with ice cream.
      It&#39;s a dream. The grand total for 4 of us was about $80 a person after tax
      and tip. It&#39;ll cost you a pretty penny, but it&#39;s worth it.<br><br>Everything
      you heard about Uchi is true. It&#39;s incredible. Get a reservation and come
      to have your mind and senses tickled and caressed as you enjoy fresh, unique,
      delicious Japanese cuisine.

      is $3 for a bottle that is about 9 little sake shots, seriously such a steal!

      be AMAZING. <br><br>I&#39;ve been going to Uchi since there was only the one
      Uchi on South Lamar in Austin. I had many anniversary dinners there and even
      had my wedding rehearsal dinner in the private room at Uchiko Austin. I LOVED
      the brussel sprouts, walu walu, nasu nigiri, ham and eggs, anago agemono, foie
      nigiri, fried milk. I&#39;ve basically had every item on every Uchi menu. I
      treasure the menu I have that Tyson Cole signed.<br><br>Over the last 2-3 years,
      though, Uchi Houston has started going down its own direction. They changed
      the sauce and components of the ham and eggs roll, the cereal (no longer cereal)
      that goes with the fried milk. It&#39;s not just menu items that come and go
      - I get it, that happens. It&#39;s not just the portions, which have been getting
      smaller. It&#39;s the fact that they KEPT iconic dishes on the menu but made
      tweaks that doesn&#39;t make culinary sense. <br><br>With that said, this is
      still a fantastic restaurant with stand-out dishes. The avo maki, spicy crunchy
      tuna, short rib, nasu, and foie nigiri are all still mindblowing. If you don&#39;t
      know the old Uchi, you will likely be quite pleased with this menu. Do plan

      all the food and inquire about all the delicious things they are making and
      I like to see before I order so if I see something appealing I always ask &#34;what
      is that and can we get 2!&#34; <br>Also if it is your first time know that you
      do not need soy sauce and wasabi that the sushi chef already seasoned your fish
      with certain flavors that the chef thinks pairs best with that fish... then
      you eat it by putting the fish on the tongue first not the rice. If this is
      your first time and you are new the waiters willl help you. <br>You can also
      tell the waiters to order for you and they will just start bringing things out
      on the menu and kindly cater towards your taste buds. Just ensure to tell them

      was unique and went so well together. <br><br>The WOW factor was definitely
      the service. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. He kept

    :body: 'TL;DR: Contemporary Japanese Fare with unique and classic dishes at a
      high price point. Definitely come during the Sake Social for very affordable
      small plates and drinks. <br><br>Uchi has long since made a name for itself
      in Houston as one of the most  (if not the most) well known resturants for high-end
      Japanese cuisine. Coming with a party of 10 people during my first visit, I
      was able to sample a large variety of the dishes and small plates, in addition
      to some of the nigiri, rolls, and desserts. Though I can attest that Uchi provides
      food and service distinctly better than the average Japanese place in Houston,
      I do think there are other Japanese resturants where your money would be better
      spent. <br><br>First of all, I would reccomend coming here during happy hour,
      or &#34;Sake Social&#34; (which runs 5-7 pm) , and only during happy hour. Uchi&#39;s
      menu is comprised of both cold and hot tastings, in addition to nigiri, rolls,
      and seasonal specials, but without the Sake Social, you&#39;ll easily spend
      70 to 80+ (unless you do one of the set courses) to leave satisfied. The Sake
      Social menu includes a pretty large variety of smaller versions of the standard
      menu items at a very reasonable price. Ordering mostly off of the Happy Hour
      menu and a few select things from the standard menu will ensure you have a filling,
      delicious, and not overly pricey experience. <br><br>Some of the stand out happy
      hour dishes included the 72 hour short rib, the walu walu, and the sake kiwi.
      The 72 hour short rib (social short rib on Sake Social menu), though a small
      portion, is very well executed dish, composed of a delicious, slightly spicy
      sauce, with lotus root and a peanut garnish adorning some very tender cubes
      of short rib. Together, it makes for a great textural and flavorful experience.
      The sake kiwi could have used a touch of salt, but it was a great deal at only
      $6 for a solid portion of salmon, and definitely made for a tasty few bites.
      The walu walu, a oak grilled piece of escolar in a flavorful sauce, was a unique
      dish that changed my previously negative perception of escolar. I would highly
      reccomend trying almost everything from the Sake Social menu that sounds or
      looks good to you.<br><br>A dish that fell short (very short) of expectations
      was the hot rock beef. Though it might make for a great Instagram pic or addition
      to your snapchat story, don&#39;t expect much else. For $17.50, you&#39;ll recieve
      5 small pieces of &#34;wagyu&#34; that taste like average sirloin, accompanied
      by a simple ponzu dipping sauce. It&#39;s by no means bad-tasting, but I&#39;d
      reccomend spending that money on a few sirloins at HEB, or at least any other
      dish on the menu. <br><br>Rolls here are nothing too special, but the ones on
      the Sake Social menu are a pretty great deal, and are good to fill you up. The
      &#34;ham and eggs&#34;, a pork belly roll served with a mustard dipping sauce,
      off of the standard menu is a little pricey, but a pretty unique and delicious
      roll worth trying at least once. I also got to sample both the dayboat scallop
      and foie gras nigiri; both were some of the most delicious bites of the entire
      dinner. Though nigiri here are a tad small, splurging for the foie piece is
      definitely worth it if you can afford it. <br><br>Uchi&#39;s Desserts are as
      expected from any high end resturant. I tried the foie gras candy bar and fried
      milk, and can definitely only reccomend the latter. The foie gras candy bar,
      while not bad, is akin to an icecream bar with a layer of cake on the bottom
      (maybe slightly reminicient of foie if you try really hard to recall the taste
      when biting into it). The fried milk is more unique, and has several components
      including a delicious salted fudge and fried condensed milk balls that all work
      well together for a few delicious final bites to your meal. <br><br>I would
      be remiss if I didn&#39;t say a word about the service at Uchi, which was excellent.
      Coordinating with a planner to reserve a table for 10 was quite easy, and our
      servers were very attentive and helpful. During happy hour, items are definitely
      a little slow to come out, though, so order early rather than adding items as

      regularly priced menu. I am curious about their omakase and other fixed menus,
      but outside of the Sake Social, I wouldn&#39;t reccomend Uchi for the price.

      dish on the menu. <br><br>Rolls here are nothing too special, but the ones on
      the Sake Social menu are a pretty great deal, and are good to fill you up. The
      &#34;ham and eggs&#34;, a pork belly roll served with a mustard dipping sauce,
      off of the standard menu is a little pricey, but a pretty unique and delicious
      roll worth trying at least once. I also got to sample both the dayboat scallop
      and foie gras nigiri; both were some of the most delicious bites of the entire
      dinner. Though nigiri here are a tad small, splurging for the foie piece is
      definitely worth it if you can afford it. <br><br>Uchi&#39;s Desserts are as
      expected from any high end resturant. I tried the foie gras candy bar and fried
      milk, and can definitely only reccomend the latter. The foie gras candy bar,
      while not bad, is akin to an icecream bar with a layer of cake on the bottom
      (maybe slightly reminicient of foie if you try really hard to recall the taste
      when biting into it). The fried milk is more unique, and has several components
      including a delicious salted fudge and fried condensed milk balls that all work
      well together for a few delicious final bites to your meal. <br><br>I would
      be remiss if I didn&#39;t say a word about the service at Uchi, which was excellent.
      Coordinating with a planner to reserve a table for 10 was quite easy, and our
      servers were very attentive and helpful. During happy hour, items are definitely
      a little slow to come out, though, so order early rather than adding items as
      you go.<br><br>Dinner at Uchi is definitely an enjoyable, delicious, and pricey
      experience. Though at a resturant like Uchi, it&#39;s expected to spend quite
      a bit, I can&#39;t say the food was good enough to warrant comnig back for the
      regularly priced menu. I am curious about their omakase and other fixed menus,
      but outside of the Sake Social, I wouldn&#39;t reccomend Uchi for the price.
      However, I am eager to return in the future and sample more of their menu. 4
      stars.'

      My friend Christina raves about this place and tells me it&#39;s hands-down

      It lived up to the hype and it was beautiful.<br><br>No surprise, but I recommend
      reservations. This place is permanently packed from open to close. It&#39;s
      a moderate size restaurant and would be perfect for any date night. It&#39;s
      loud, but it&#39;s cozy enough to be intimate. We got a reservation and sat
      at the sushi bar. I think this allows for the best experience. You are thrown
      into the proverbial trenches with the sushi chefs and you get to watch them
      masterfully work their craft. The chefs are friendly, helpful, entertaining,

      to get an idea of what kind of food you can expect. Don&#39;t come here expecting
      California rolls or sweet and sticky rolls drenched in sauces. This is classic
      and clean high-end sushi with a nice neo-modern twist. Most of your senses will
      be delighted with the different savory to sweet profiles.<br><br>Some of my
      favorites were the salmon belly, yellow tail everything, and really just ask
      the chefs for recommendations. They won&#39;t let you down as everything tasted
      like a new experience. The thing I DIE FOR is the foie gras. GOOD. GOD. It was
      a culinary orgasmic experience. I&#39;ve never tasted anything so sweet, juicy,
      succulent, savory, that offered this beautifully light crisp on the outside
      while maintaining a buttery-melt-in-your-mouth finish. It is unreal. You could
      have it for dessert honestly. The ACTUAL dessert of fried milk is really good.
      It&#39;s condensed milk fried in a doughnut like casing served with ice cream.
      It&#39;s a dream. The grand total for 4 of us was about $80 a person after tax
      and tip. It&#39;ll cost you a pretty penny, but it&#39;s worth it.<br><br>Everything

      go to is the crunchy chicken sandwich. The sandwich consists of layers of chicken,
      seasoned tomatoes and lettuce, pickles, ranch, and crushed salt and pepper chips.
      The combination of flavors really complement each other so well. The absolutely
      star of the dish is the pretzal bun. It is both soft and a little bit crispy
      at the same time and the flavor is so wonderful. This sandwich needs a heavy
      duty bun to keep everything in line and this pretzal bun is up for the job.<br><br>Sandwiches
      come with two sides. The sides differ from location to location and I believe
      they also change depending on what is in season. I ordered the summer pasta
      (pasta salad with cherry tomatoes and olives) and the potato salad. The summer
      pasta is good if you like olives (if you&#39;re into that kind of thing). The
      potato salad was incredibly refreshing. It had a nice dill flavor and felt so
      light.<br><br>Important tip: you can ask for a pretzal bun on any sandwich,

      to figure out what we wanted to eat (despite the streamlined menu) because everything

      with homemade chips. They we&#39;re both phenomenal. I don&#39;t mean just good,
      I mean crazy, mouthwatering awesome. The sandwiches were both stuffed and the
      sides were also delicious. One plus is that we got to enjoy a nice early afternoon
      in the shade of their patio, which offers a pretty decent view.   <br><br>Overall,

    :body: Local Foods is always a good option. This cafeteria-style spot offers a
      revolving menu, in addition to their standard list of salads, sandwiches, and
      sides. There&#39;s also a fun (and local) craft beer list. As of this review,
      I&#39;ve been to this location countless times and have always ordered the crunchy
      chicken sandwich served on a pretzel bun. Just great. Everything is remarkably
      fresh and the service is super friendly.

    :comment: Crunchy Chicken Sandwich
    :body: 'I always feels so healthy eating at a Local Foods. Plus it is delicious.<br><br>My
      go to is the crunchy chicken sandwich. The sandwich consists of layers of chicken,
      seasoned tomatoes and lettuce, pickles, ranch, and crushed salt and pepper chips.
      The combination of flavors really complement each other so well. The absolutely
      star of the dish is the pretzal bun. It is both soft and a little bit crispy
      at the same time and the flavor is so wonderful. This sandwich needs a heavy
      duty bun to keep everything in line and this pretzal bun is up for the job.<br><br>Sandwiches
      come with two sides. The sides differ from location to location and I believe
      they also change depending on what is in season. I ordered the summer pasta
      (pasta salad with cherry tomatoes and olives) and the potato salad. The summer
      pasta is good if you like olives (if you&#39;re into that kind of thing). The
      potato salad was incredibly refreshing. It had a nice dill flavor and felt so
      light.<br><br>Important tip: you can ask for a pretzal bun on any sandwich,
      it really kicks it up a notch!'

    :body: I visited Local Foods for the first time today and was extremely impressed.
      The interior was very nice and absolutely pristine. Additionally, from the moment
      we walked in, staff was welcoming and helpful. We actually had a hard time trying
      to figure out what we wanted to eat (despite the streamlined menu) because everything
      looked so good. I settled on the &#34;Crunchy&#34; Chicken sandwich with pickle
      spears and fresh fruit. My wife ended up with the Gulf Shrimp and Crab sandwich
      with homemade chips. They we&#39;re both phenomenal. I don&#39;t mean just good,
      I mean crazy, mouthwatering awesome. The sandwiches were both stuffed and the
      sides were also delicious. One plus is that we got to enjoy a nice early afternoon
      in the shade of their patio, which offers a pretty decent view.   <br><br>Overall,
      I can&#39;t say enough good about my first experience with Local Foods. I will
      tell you that I liked it so much I seriously considered going back for dinner
      the same day. Check it out!!!

  - :body: Best little bakery in Houston!! Common Bond has the eye candy angle down
      pat. On our way through town, our family grabbed a number of pastries for our
      upcoming vacation.  Every single one was delicious...the pistachio croissant,
      chocolate chip cookie, Boston cream kugelhopf, and the macarons. I take that
      back. One of the macarons was stale, and they replaced it for me once I brought
      it to their attention. I was seriously considering hitting Common Bond on our
      way back from vacation! Sadly, didn&#39;t get to. <br><br>We brought our two
      year old and 6 month old baby with us for a short cup of coffee. The other guests
      seemed pretty open to them and there were other young children at the bakery
      as well, although I wouldn&#39;t consider this a kid friendly place, but it
      worked for us. The inside of the bakery is so jammed with tables (due to their
      popularity I&#39;m sure) that there wasn&#39;t space for us to maneuver our
      extremely small, nimble stroller. But I would absolutely come back anytime I
      can.

  - :body: Absolutely, hands down my favorite brunch place on the planet! If I lived
      in Houston I would probably be here every weekend. <br><br>After my friend and
      I had had a wild night out the night before, I was ready for grease, eggs and
      maybe a little hair of the dog. My friend? Not so much. She wasn&#39;t doing
      so well, but we went anyway. <br><br>Being an eggs benny gal, I didn&#39;t even
      bother to look at the rest of the menu. They have a nice selection of about
      7-8 eggs bennys. An added bonus is that you can mix and match if you want or
      just order one. I like places with customized choices like that. I ordered the
      avocado smash(and it was, a smash I mean) and added bacon. It comes with hash
      browns served in a neat cylindrical shape that&#39;s just, well, neat! I also
      ordered the Boss hog bloody mary made with bacon infused whiskey. It was just
      the hair of the dog I needed topped with an elaborate coliflor, pickle, olive
      garnish with a huge piece of bacon bobbing out of it. I felt guilty for a moment
      as my friend headed to the bathroom holding her stomach, but still managed to
      wolf and slurp everything down. <br><br>Luckily, the next day my friend was
      feeling like herself again and when she asked me where I wanted to go for brunch,
      I immediately said &#34;Snooze! I have to check out the rest of the menu!&#34;
       Off we went where I had an omelette and a cup of joe, like a proper person.
      <br><br>I&#39;ll be back for sure. I hear they have 4 other locations in the
      US.

  - :body: This place was PACKED! It&#39;s basically in the heart of Montrose, so
      you guessed it.. NO PARKING! <br>We were having a bridal brunch so it was 8
      of us.. you can&#39;t make a res so it&#39;s first come first serve. We planned
      to arrive at 11, but some of the ladies arrived at 10:15 to wait for a table.<br>I
      am always late, so I didn&#39;t arrive until 11:30 and guess what, my entire
      party was still outside waiting on a table. We didn&#39;t get seated until 12pm.
      That&#39;s a little ridiculous. It&#39;s hotter than jalepenos outside and they
      have you waiting, no water, no misty fans, nothing.<br><br>The food definitely
      made up for the extreme wait. Massive burritos, hasbrowns, tacos, shrimp and
      grits all filled our tables -- not one complaint. <br>Service was a little slow,
      but I get it.. it&#39;s brunch and we all get weeded.<br>Everyone else ordered
      flavored mimosas and enjoyed them, but lil ol&#39; me just had to get tequila.
      I got the watermelon jalapeño rita and it was less than pleasant. I didn&#39;t
      even drink it, and don&#39;t waste alcohol. So needless to say, that was a waste.
      <br><br>I do like the checkout system, the server brought out 2 electronic pads
      for us to pay and that was probably the most exciting part of the visit. YIKES!

  - :body: This place is popular for good reason! This location isn&#39;t too large
      so depending on the time you come expect a longgg wait (up to 1 hr). No reservations
      <br><br>The food is worth it! I usually split a sweet item and a savory item.
      I have loved all of their sweet items including the OMG french toast, pineapple
      pancake, and the sweet potato pancakes. For savory I go for the breakfast burrito
      but replace the eggs to make it vegan. The hashbrowns inside the burrito is
      a nice touch. Incredibly filling burrito. Huge portion size. <br><br>The parking
      here is horrible. Only about 8 spots total in the lot. Lots of street parking
      nearby though. <br><br>The service here is very hit or miss. We&#39;ve had a
      fantastic waiter here who went above and beyond. We&#39;ve also had one of the
      worst waiters I&#39;ve had of any service experience this location. He spilled
      coffee creamer on our table and didn&#39;t clean it up, forgot to bring out
      the sauce that typically comes with our meals, and didn&#39;t bring us utensils.
      <br><br>Still would definitely return for the food.

  - :body: A wonderful place for breakfast with a friendly staff. I had the breakfast
      pot pie.  Flaky puff pastry with an awesome country gravy. Also came with house
      made hash browns.  Soo good. Sister in law had the shrimp &amp; grits. Sausage
      had some bite but all and all good. The grits was very tasty and made me forget
      I don&#39;t like grits. The omg French toast was done well. And the pancake
      flight was all good. My favorite from the trio was the pineapple upside down
      pancake.  <br><br>Highly recommend. Only downside parking kinda sucks. One small

  - :body: So was in Houston visiting and woke up wanting to try some food spots.
      One good spot that jumped out because if it&#39;s name. Snooze. I thought it
      was a funny name. So i pulled up and the scene was in a nice area and that was
      truly a plus. (Needs more parking only complaint) <br><br>Menu is next on the
      list. Options options options. I love that they have so many options to choose
      from. It&#39;s a little overwhelming but in a good way. Since I&#39;m trying
      to stay on my life style i went with the breakfast tacos and this was my first
      time trying a tofu meat substitute. It was really good. I thought i was not
      going like it but man oh man was i wrong. I also had a mimosa with it to compliment.
      <br><br>Overall it was a great experience. Can truly say one of the better brunch
      spots i have eaten in a while. It was so good. The service was great and most
      importantly not overcharging.

  - :body: I had a fantastic brunch at Snooze this morning! Arriving as early as 9am,
      the wait was still ~30 minutes...but after finally getting a chance to try the
      place I see why Snooze gets long lines out the door!<br><br>We were quickly
      helped and our server was very kind. I tried the Ooo La La Frittata, which was
      like a scrambled egg pancake with cheese, asparagus, cucumbers, and topped with
      a salad. It definitely didn&#39;t disappoint, and it was really flavorful! I
      also got the nitro cold brew, which was okay and not as strong as I would have
      liked.<br><br>I also had the chance to try the Sweet Potato Hash (which was
      also light and flavorful), the Steak + Eggs Benny (really dense and delicious).<br><br>Definitely
      satisfied with my experience at Snooze. I&#39;d been talking about visiting

  - :body: On our arrival, the parking lot was crazy full. People were stacked waiting
      for spaces like there was a going out of business sale. It made it a little
      exciting to see.<br><br>We checked in and were told there was a 30 minute wait.
      Eventually they called our name from inside and we were waiting outside. When
      we got the text, we responded and were told &#34;sorry you&#39;re too late we
      already gave your table away. But we will seat you soon.&#34; Only seconds later
      we were seated.<br><br>At the table we were given dirty menus and a sticky table.
      Our drink order was taken immediately and brought to us just as quickly. I requested
      silverware and creamer only to wait until my coffee was cold and my orange juice
      was finished.<br><br>Everything coming out of the Kitchen looks and smells amazing!
      Seems like many people order some variation of pancakes or Benedict from what
      passes by our table.<br><br>We ordered pancakes and Benedict. The Pancakes were
      very dry and the drizzle was quite tasty. The Benedict&#39;s were interesting
      good. Tons of flavor and the hollandaise was incredible.<br><br>There were many
      staff shuffling plates and people making things a little hectic and distracting.
      The music was pumping and loud. The decor was retro modern. The give a high
      tech receipt on a tablet you self service.<br><br>A complaint is that the personal
      interacting with the server or host is lacking. As I finished my plate, it was
      quickly grabbed and the receipt device was placed on our table.<br><br>It&#39;s
      a place to go if you are a trendy hipster. If you are hungry now, forget it.

      and not overloaded with chocolate like most other places do. the bacon could
      have been a literally warmer and a tad bit crispier. The hash browns we&#39;re
      good , but nothing that kicks u off of your feet. The hot cocoa was the star

      before we went to the zoo. We sat in a giant booth and I honestly had to lean
      forward to eat but that Bravocado toast was worth it. Our waitress was super
      friendly and always made sure we had everything we needed. She didn&#39;t even
      complain when the baby we had with us made a huge watery mess. <br><br>The bravocado
      toast was AMAZING. The rustic bread and red onion jam was such a great combination.
      It almost tasted Italian but had fried eggs on top which made it breakfasty.
      The bread was drizzled with oil but was still crispy. It came with a nice arugula
      salad with fresh Parmesan cheese on top and a glass of fresh orange juice. I
      wish i could have eaten every single bite but I was full after one egg/toast.
      <br><br>Parking was kind of a hassle but we were lucky enough to find a spot
      up front and they had benches for sitting and waiting (including some outdoor
      eating areas). I can&#39;t wait to come back and taste the sweet potato hash
      or one of their infamous pastries.

      Parking is pretty bad so be prepared for that or uber. <br><br>I ordered the
      Abri-Ca-Lac-Ra mimosa and my boyfriend had the Mmm Mmm mimosa. They were so
      good! I wish they sold by the caraft! My boyfriend decided on the pineapple
      upside down pancake. I of course couldn&#39;t decide between the shrimp and
      grits and the OMG French Toast so the waiter suggested I get a half of each.
      <br><br>The shrimp and grits had a great flavor. They used ground sausage which
      was something new but it was really good. I def would try again. The French
      toast was very rich! Definitely glad I got a half plate. The pineapple upside
      down cake was amazing but we definitely recommend getting a half plate unless

      location. Even though from the exterior it looks really small, they have a lot
      of tables inside and turn over tables pretty quickly. We waited for 20 minutes
      for our table which is one of the shortest wait time I&#39;ve had for a Saturday
      morning. <br><br>Food was delectable as always. Service was great. Parking is

  - :body: As a brunch lover on a budget, I&#39;ve been dying to try Snooze for quite
      some time. It&#39;s a tad expensive for my taste, but I decided to splurge after
      a late night with my friend A.<br><br>I&#39;ve heard stories about the ridiculous
      wait times here, but fortunately we didn&#39;t experience that given how early
      on a Sunday morning we arrived. We came around 10 am and were given a table
      after a 20 minute wait. We&#39;d already made our brunch selections and were
      in a bit of a hurry, so we ordered immediately on being seated.<br><br>We decided
      to share the pancake flight with the cannoli, pineapple upside down, and blueberry
      danish pancakes, and the Smashed Avocado Benny.<br>Our food came out fairly
      quickly, and we were not disappointed. The portion sizes were pretty big for
      two college-age women, so we ended up taking a lot of the food to go. The cannoli
      pancake was a bit sweet for me, but I adored the pineapple upside down and blueberry
      danish ones. Specialty pancakes are one of my weaknesses, and let&#39;s just
      say that Snooze pancakes took my breath away. The Benny we ordered was similarly
      tasty, but didn&#39;t seem as inspired as the rest of the menu. My next time
      here, I&#39;d like to try one of the meat Benny options to see how it compares.<br><br>Upon
      finishing, we were given an electronic tablet to pay for our meal. This is definitely
      better if you&#39;re paying with credit card, but cash is a bit of a nightmare
      as you have to wait for already busy servers to come give you change. Regardless,
      Snooze was a pretty great experience and I&#39;ll definitely be back (though
      sometime EARLY to avoid those pesky lines...)

      pot pie.  Flaky puff pastry with an awesome country gravy. Also came with house
      made hash browns.  Soo good. Sister in law had the shrimp &amp; grits. Sausage
      had some bite but all and all good. The grits was very tasty and made me forget
      I don&#39;t like grits. The omg French toast was done well. And the pancake
      flight was all good. My favorite from the trio was the pineapple upside down
      pancake.  <br><br>Highly recommend. Only downside parking kinda sucks. One small
      lot and street parking

    :body: So was in Houston visiting and woke up wanting to try some food spots.
      One good spot that jumped out because if it&#39;s name. Snooze. I thought it
      was a funny name. So i pulled up and the scene was in a nice area and that was
      truly a plus. (Needs more parking only complaint) <br><br>Menu is next on the
      list. Options options options. I love that they have so many options to choose
      from. It&#39;s a little overwhelming but in a good way. Since I&#39;m trying
      to stay on my life style i went with the breakfast tacos and this was my first
      time trying a tofu meat substitute. It was really good. I thought i was not
      going like it but man oh man was i wrong. I also had a mimosa with it to compliment.
      <br><br>Overall it was a great experience. Can truly say one of the better brunch
      spots i have eaten in a while. It was so good. The service was great and most
      importantly not overcharging.

    :body: I had a fantastic brunch at Snooze this morning! Arriving as early as 9am,
      the wait was still ~30 minutes...but after finally getting a chance to try the
      place I see why Snooze gets long lines out the door!<br><br>We were quickly
      helped and our server was very kind. I tried the Ooo La La Frittata, which was
      like a scrambled egg pancake with cheese, asparagus, cucumbers, and topped with
      a salad. It definitely didn&#39;t disappoint, and it was really flavorful! I
      also got the nitro cold brew, which was okay and not as strong as I would have
      liked.<br><br>I also had the chance to try the Sweet Potato Hash (which was
      also light and flavorful), the Steak + Eggs Benny (really dense and delicious).<br><br>Definitely
      satisfied with my experience at Snooze. I&#39;d been talking about visiting
      it for months and I now understand the hype.

      Parking is pretty bad so be prepared for that or uber. <br><br>I ordered the
      Abri-Ca-Lac-Ra mimosa and my boyfriend had the Mmm Mmm mimosa. They were so
      good! I wish they sold by the caraft! My boyfriend decided on the pineapple
      upside down pancake. I of course couldn&#39;t decide between the shrimp and
      grits and the OMG French Toast so the waiter suggested I get a half of each.
      <br><br>The shrimp and grits had a great flavor. They used ground sausage which
      was something new but it was really good. I def would try again. The French
      toast was very rich! Definitely glad I got a half plate. The pineapple upside
      down cake was amazing but we definitely recommend getting a half plate unless

      in a bit of a hurry, so we ordered immediately on being seated.<br><br>We decided
      to share the pancake flight with the cannoli, pineapple upside down, and blueberry
      danish pancakes, and the Smashed Avocado Benny.<br>Our food came out fairly
      quickly, and we were not disappointed. The portion sizes were pretty big for
      two college-age women, so we ended up taking a lot of the food to go. The cannoli
      pancake was a bit sweet for me, but I adored the pineapple upside down and blueberry
      danish ones. Specialty pancakes are one of my weaknesses, and let&#39;s just
      say that Snooze pancakes took my breath away. The Benny we ordered was similarly
      tasty, but didn&#39;t seem as inspired as the rest of the menu. My next time
      here, I&#39;d like to try one of the meat Benny options to see how it compares.<br><br>Upon
      finishing, we were given an electronic tablet to pay for our meal. This is definitely
      better if you&#39;re paying with credit card, but cash is a bit of a nightmare
      as you have to wait for already busy servers to come give you change. Regardless,

      and also laid back. Which is really nice, because when it is hot as hell out,
      and everyone is sweating.... like the meat they they are cooking!! (Buh-dum
      tiss) But we ordered like a family deal since there was 6 adults and 2 kids
      and a baby. (I should say two babies because my partner is such a baby but we
      can count them as an adult.)<br><br>But, the food was pretty darn good over
      all. It was probably a lot more than we thought we could eat, but the sauce
      was mainly the best part. It was spicy and juicy and its making me drool right
      now. The sausage, chicken, brisket and shredded meat was really good. Those
      were probably my favorite with the least favorite being the ribs. (This is because
      I don&#39;t really like charring on my meat too much.) We also got lots of sauce
      to go along with all the meat, which was very nice. <br><br>As for the sides,
      the mac and cheese was a bit standard.. Which was a bit disappointing to me.
      I guess because this place is talked up about so much I was looking for something
      more in the mac and cheese. Something just.. more than just basic mac and cheese.
      It was also the same way for the beans as well. I was looking for something
      more since the hype is so real, but was kind of left behind the band wagon.
      Honestly, I think my favorite side dish was the potato salad. Which it might
      be just the fact that I was missing mayo, but it had a good crunch and the overall
      flavor was pretty on point and outside of your basic potato salad. <br><br>Bottom

      fatty briskets, beef rib, and the cheddar jalapeño sausage with sides of elote,

      accurate ratio of fat vs meat, and all the right flavors! Something that stood

      trying since other places we&#39;ve been to didn&#39;t offer it.  The bbq sauce
      was good here. It had a good sweet and tangy taste that went well with the bbq.

      Pit Room <br><br>I only wish the airport was closer to the Pit Room otherwise
      I would have been there sooner. This was my first Texas BBQ experience. Sure,
      we have &#34;BBQ&#34; in New York, but this is an animal of a different caliber.
      <br><br>On a Wednesday at lunchtime [circa 1:00PM], there was only one woman
      ahead of me on line, but the indoor dining room was quite full. The patio adjacent
      to the Pit Room was empty, but that&#39;s because it was sweltering Texas-style.
      <br><br>I ordered the two meat dinner plate [$15.75] with brisket and pork ribs.
      The meat plates come with white bread and two sides. I chose the elote, which
      I now have a love affair with, and the coleslaw, which was equally satisfying.
      <br><br>The brisket was smokey. It was pull apart soft and the meat on the pork
      ribs fell right off. It was delicious on it&#39;s own without the BBQ sauce
      on the side. I actually even forgot it was there until I cleared my plate. Speaking
      of forgetting things, I&#39;m annoyed with myself that I forgot to grab the
      homemade pickle condiments from the bar as I rushed out to sit on the patio.<br><br>But
      that elote though.... I&#39;ve never had elote as good in my life. I love that
      it comes in a cup, filled to the brim with corn, cheese, and hot sauce. I&#39;ve
      only ever had it on the cob. All things are not created equal. The coleslaw
      was crisp and refreshing, especially after the heaviness of the meat and the
      elote. <br><br>Honestly, the white bread was the only part of the meal that
      I did not enjoy. It was kind of stale, or maybe that&#39;s how it&#39;s suppose
      to be? <br><br>I also could not resist ordering the cherry pie [$4.50]. It was
      chock full of plump cherries. The pastry was a bit soggy in the middle but that&#39;s
      probably because I left it out in the heat while I ate the rest of the meal.
      The crust was firm and perfect though. Quite frankly, this cherry pie might
      have changed my life.<br><br>I grabbed a cider from the bar that caters to the
      patio. It seems that the cider wasn&#39;t out yet in the main dining area. No
      worries, it gave me an opportunity to check out the rest of the place. I don&#39;t
      remember which cider I had but it definitely cost less than what it is in New
      York.<br><br>About $25 for a more than exemplary meal that left me stuffed.<br><br>I

      y&#39;all because the flavor was blasting with every bite, seasoning was just
      right ( btw if yall stole Beavers BBQ seasoning and put it on yalls, I&#39;ll

      cole slaw. White bread. Cherry pie [$4.50] and a cider.
    :body: 'Noon: Land at George Bush International Airport<br>1:00PM: Arrive at the
      Pit Room <br><br>I only wish the airport was closer to the Pit Room otherwise
      I would have been there sooner. This was my first Texas BBQ experience. Sure,
      we have &#34;BBQ&#34; in New York, but this is an animal of a different caliber.
      <br><br>On a Wednesday at lunchtime [circa 1:00PM], there was only one woman
      ahead of me on line, but the indoor dining room was quite full. The patio adjacent
      to the Pit Room was empty, but that&#39;s because it was sweltering Texas-style.
      <br><br>I ordered the two meat dinner plate [$15.75] with brisket and pork ribs.
      The meat plates come with white bread and two sides. I chose the elote, which
      I now have a love affair with, and the coleslaw, which was equally satisfying.
      <br><br>The brisket was smokey. It was pull apart soft and the meat on the pork
      ribs fell right off. It was delicious on it&#39;s own without the BBQ sauce
      on the side. I actually even forgot it was there until I cleared my plate. Speaking
      of forgetting things, I&#39;m annoyed with myself that I forgot to grab the
      homemade pickle condiments from the bar as I rushed out to sit on the patio.<br><br>But
      that elote though.... I&#39;ve never had elote as good in my life. I love that
      it comes in a cup, filled to the brim with corn, cheese, and hot sauce. I&#39;ve
      only ever had it on the cob. All things are not created equal. The coleslaw
      was crisp and refreshing, especially after the heaviness of the meat and the
      elote. <br><br>Honestly, the white bread was the only part of the meal that
      I did not enjoy. It was kind of stale, or maybe that&#39;s how it&#39;s suppose
      to be? <br><br>I also could not resist ordering the cherry pie [$4.50]. It was
      chock full of plump cherries. The pastry was a bit soggy in the middle but that&#39;s
      probably because I left it out in the heat while I ate the rest of the meal.
      The crust was firm and perfect though. Quite frankly, this cherry pie might
      have changed my life.<br><br>I grabbed a cider from the bar that caters to the
      patio. It seems that the cider wasn&#39;t out yet in the main dining area. No
      worries, it gave me an opportunity to check out the rest of the place. I don&#39;t
      remember which cider I had but it definitely cost less than what it is in New
      York.<br><br>About $25 for a more than exemplary meal that left me stuffed.<br><br>I
      don&#39;t know what other Texas BBQ places taste like but all I know is that
      I need to eat more barbecue.'

      here seemed very enthused about working and being here. The vibe is warm and
      cozy, it doesn&#39;t take many people to make the line go out the door, so when
      it&#39;s very busy you can find yourself waiting outside. The line moves very
      quick though, if they get too busy, there is extra seating next door in &#34;The
      patio&#34;. I feel like the prices per portion however are slightly inflated
      due to the neighboring neighborhoods, the prices are not absurd, just that for
      a cheaper price and not much change in taste, you can go somewhere else. You
      won&#39;t be upset here at all however, I would recommend The Pit Room if you

  - :body: 'Service and ambiance is always impeccable. Food is interesting and done
      well, but slightly hits the mark sometimes. <br><br>I&#39;ve had: Bobotie, Espetada,
      Durban Butter Chicken, Great Karoo Lamb Chops, Sticky Toffee Pudding, and the
      Melktart Brulee on two separate occasions. <br><br>Get the Bobotie, it&#39;s
      amazing and if you have a small appetite this could totally be your entire meal.
      It&#39;s basically a beef pot pie with a sweet and curried twist to it. Extra
      flaky, hot, and super satisfying.<br><br>The temperature of the espetada, butter
      chicken, and lamb chops were all mediocre. The potion sizes of everything is
      very average. Not like everything was one bite, but even me, someone who&#39;s
      5ft, felt like it was a little skimpy. <br><br>The butter chicken was room temperature
      on one side and a little warmer on the other which was strange...The flavors
      were a little bland and needed some more spice, but overall not the worst thing
      I&#39;ve tasted.<br><br>Espetada is an interesting and fun dish! It&#39;s worth
      getting this at least once to see what South African cuisine is like, but between
      this and the lamb chops I would go with the lamb.<br><br>Speaking of, the lamb
      chops could have used some help with temperature. We were one of few tables
      in the restaurant, so I was confused about why it wasn&#39;t hot, but flavor
      wise it was good! If it was thicker I would&#39;ve been much happier with it.
      The mint sauce to accompany was good. Nothing to write home about, but if the
      lamb were a little fattier I think the mint sauce would serve its purpose entirely
      and offer some acidity to cut through the fat. Since it was lean and thin it
      was a little overpowering. <br><br>Sticky toffee pudding is extremely popular,
      but always slightly disappointing for me. Personally, I think they always skimp
      on the ice cream when in reality it needs more! I am not particularly a fan
      of it, so I didn&#39;t order it the second time and instead went for the Melktart.
      I think this was my mistake as I didn&#39;t carefully read what the difference
      between a Melktart and a traditional Creme Brulee is, but either way it was
      not my favorite. The cream on top was fresh and very thick and I happily ate
      all of that.<br><br>What sells me on this place is the ambiance and the service.
      I&#39;ve always had great service here and my boyfriend and I celebrated both
      our 1-year and 2-year anniversary here unintentionally. We received free champagne
      the first time, and a mini sticky-toffee pudding the second time. Make sure
      to get reservations if it&#39;s a Friday or Saturday night because otherwise
      you may be stuck in the bar area. The main dining area is absolutely gorgeous
      and I love the curvature of the ceiling. It&#39;s modern, elegant, and ties
      into the restaurant perfectly. It never disappoints to simply sit here. <br><br>Will
      I be back? Debatable. The ambiance really never disappoints.'

  - :body: Our family really enjoyed my recent haul of food from Little Miss BBQ.
      It&#39;s clearly one of the best BBQ places in The Valley. <br><br>I bought
      three and a half pounds of Chopped Brisket ($18.50 lbs) and Pastrami ($22.00
      lbs), along with some sides of Potato Salad, Cole Slaw and Cheddar Jalapeño
      Grits ($5.00 each). <br><br>Sadly their Sausages, Turkey, Sliced Brisket and
      Ribs were all gone before we could get up to the counter.  Oh, well.  I did
      get the chance to meet some very nice out of town woman from Las Vegas; along
      with three men who arrived by Über from Sky Harbor, they just had to have some
      their famous BBQ. LOL<br><br>James and all the other employees from Little Miss
      BBQ were exceptional, as we waited over 45 mins.  Given the 107 degrees temps,
      the had the water misters on and made sure everyone was hydrated by offering
      us free water.  But truth be told, I found their Jalapeño Grits to be the best.
       Just loved their grits. <br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>Post Script - The earlier you
      come, the better your chances are of not being shut out of your favorite BBQ
      meat. Also, the meats can sometimes get dried out, even when wrapped in their
      butcher paper while being kept in the warmer. Caveat Emptor. <br><br>PSS - Their
      Sunnyslope location usually has a short line.

  - :body: The best food I&#39;ve had in my five or so visits to Phoenix! Yeah, I
      said it. <br><br>My colleague and I came straight here from the airport for
      lunch. We arrived a little after 10:00 am and so had to wait an hour until they
      opened. Thankfully, they have chairs to tailgate and the staff was super friendly,
      so chatted us up and gave out samples until they opened officially at 11:00
      am. <br><br>We shared two two meat plates ($16) which let us try every type
      of meat and all the sides. I&#39;d consider myself a side gal but wasn&#39;t
      blown away. We tried the potato salad, slaw, jalapeño grits and beans. I found
      the potato salad to be the best which surprised me because I usually don&#39;t
      love it. Their version is light on the sauce and doesn&#39;t have unnecessary
      additions like hard boiled eggs. Everything else wasn&#39;t bad but it was easy
      for me to save room for the meat! <br><br>The star of the show is definitely
      the meat. If I HAD to pick only two, I would probably do the brisket and sausage,
      but it would be quite sad if you couldn&#39;t try the ribs. There were three
      types of BBQ sauce on the table and I rotated between all of them, not able
      to land on a favorite because they were so good. Everything was tender and packed
      with flavor. <br><br>To end, we split a pecan pie which is a solid decision
      no matter how full you may be. It was super gooey and rich. Definitely beat
      the pecan pies that regularly grace my Thanksgiving dinner table. <br><br>I
      found it funny that the Uber drivers that dropped us off and picked us up had
      no idea what Little Miss BBQ was. Its close proximity to the airport (and stellar
      Yelp reviews) undoubtedly make it a tourist destination but it clearly deserves
      the love.

      seeing Little Miss BBQ pop up as the #2 ranked restaurant in the country on
      Yelp in 2018, I immediately bookmarked it and knew that I would absolutely be
      visiting on an upcoming trip to the Phoenix area. I landed at the airport, got
      my rental car and drove straight there... only to see that the line was so long
      that it just wasn&#39;t conceivable that I&#39;d be able to wait. I had tickets
      to a spring training game and would have basically missed the whole game, which
      wasn&#39;t an option.<br><br>14 months later, I have another trip to Phoenix.
      I book an even earlier flight and clear my schedule for the entire day. Myself
      and a colleague arrive at 9:40a and are the first two people in line. Great
      success!<br><br>Because the aforementioned colleague and I perfectly align when
      it comes to these things, we basically picked out our favorite 4 meats and sides
      and shared everything. It&#39;s truly the only way to do Little Miss BBQ.<br><br>---MEATS---<br><br>Brisket:
      5-stars. We were given a sample when we walked up to the counter to order and
      it was absolute perfection. While it was a tad better fresh out of the foil
      than it was 20 minutes into our meal, this brisket was about as good as it gets.
      It would be hard to find someone who says otherwise.<br><br>Sausage: 4-stars.
      There was a certain kind of flavor with this sausage that I couldn&#39;t quite
      put my finger on. I enjoyed it very much and it was so juicy that it almost
      tasted like when I bit into it that a little water would come out, as weird
      as that sounds. If you like sausage, don&#39;t miss ordering this.<br><br>Pulled
      Pork: 5-stars. I feel like pulled pork has the least amount of variance of any
      BBQ meat, but they certainly didn&#39;t mess this up. If I had to come back
      for only two meats, this would be one of them, along with the brisket.<br><br>Pork
      Rib: 5-stars. I really can&#39;t complain about these ribs in any way. When
      you imagine having some delicious ribs, Little Miss BBQ pretty much serves you
      what you day dream about.<br><br>---SIDES---<br><br>Ranchero Beans: 3-stars.
      I think the issue might be more that I just don&#39;t love this kind of bean.
      They were fine, but I wouldn&#39;t order again.<br><br>Potato Salad: 5-stars.
      The star of the show with the sides, IMO. It was a bit unique from what I&#39;m
      used to with potato salad, in that the potatoes were diced into small cubes.
      I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen that before. But more importantly, the flavor
      was the ideal pairing for all the BBQ we had on our plates.<br><br>Coleslaw:
      3-stars. Pretty standard coleslaw - not bad, but not anything special.<br><br>Jalapeno
      Grits: 5-stars. Another great pairing to go along with all of the meat. If you&#39;re
      worried about this being spicy, throw those thoughts aside. I hate spicy foods
      and I didn&#39;t notice even a small kick.<br><br>---SAUCE---<br><br>Each table
      came with a bottle of standard, spicy and mustard sauce. I enjoyed all three
      of them. Just like with the grits, I didn&#39;t notice any kind of kick, so
      don&#39;t be shy to try it, even if you&#39;re not a fan of spicy things. I
      enjoyed all three sauces very much, but stuck mostly with the standard. 5-stars.<br><br>---CUSTOMER
      SERVICE---<br><br>An easy 5-stars. Every person we encountered wasn&#39;t just
      friendly, but ridiculously nice. I felt like I was at someone&#39;s house, rather
      than at a restaurant. And that&#39;s pretty impressive for a place to uphold
      that level of service when they have a line wrapped around the building every
      day.<br><br>It&#39;s no wonder that Little Miss BBQ has 2,000+ reviews and a
      5-star rating. It&#39;s virtually impossible to keep that up, but I get how
      these guys have done it - they are awesome all-around!'

      lot holds ~30 cars, but it was full by 11:15. Most early arrivals dined in,
      but a couple people made to go orders, intermittently freeing up spots before
      the first diners left. When we left around 12:45, there were ample spots open.<br><br>Meats:<br>-Our
      favorite was definitely the pork rib - the meat slipped off the bone, and it
      was super juicy.<br>-The beef short rib (an absolute unit) had a flavor that
      reminded me of peppery beef jerky. The giant bone helped retain moisture in
      the meat, and the flavor was wonderful.<br>-Next came the fatty brisket. I thought
      the brisket was above above average but didn&#39;t think it fully live up to
      the hype - the fatty portion on top was great, but the bottom portion was carried
      by the top half.<br>-Pulled pork was also fantastic. We tried some turkey, which
      was extremely Smokey and delicious on turkey standards, but definitely outshone
      by the previous 3. Sausage was also good - loved that snappy casing.<br><br>Sides:
      We didn&#39;t get the cole slaw, but got single orders ($2.50 each) of the grits,
      baked beans, and potato salad. Grits were the favorite (super creamy), then
      the potato salad (clean cubes in a non mayo-y sauce), then the baked beans (I&#39;m
      partial to sweeter baked beans, but these still weren&#39;t bad). Complimentary
      toppings included some superb pickles, as well as pickled jalapeños and sliced
      white onion. The white bread they give prevents more room for meat in your tummy,
      but definitely helps digestion later on. Sauces were all great too!<br><br>Everyone
      is seriously SO nice. We were constantly offered water to stay hydrated, and

      Beef short ribs only on Friday and Saturday<br>- Pastrami on Thursdays<br>-
      Lots of outdoor picnic tables, and indoor seating has 5 tables of four<br>-

      don&#39;t expect a shorter line by any means <br>- If you&#39;re worried about
      waiting outside, they have ample shade, misters, and water to keep you alive
      (I thought the wait flew by, but maybe that was just me).<br>- Also, I ate a
      ridiculous amount of meat, didn&#39;t eat anything for the rest of the day,

      out. It opens at 11am and it was pretty hot and sunny day. We came around 10:30am
      before they open and we were shocked that the line was already long. The parking
      lot was a bit tight so we had to find parking then we waited in line. It was
      a hot day, but they&#39;re very thoughtful of putting the drinking water outside
      for everybody and they also have misters outside for us while waiting, it helps
      a lot especially around summer time. They have inside seatings as well, but
      it&#39;s pretty tight. <br><br>It was an hour and a half wait. When we got the
      food, it was already 12pm. We got the smoked brisket, the pork ribs, sausages,
      and the pecan pie. Everything was delicious except the pecan pie, surprisingly;
      because pecan pie is one of my favorite dessert, but I don&#39;t like the pecan
      pie here very much because it was hard on top but jelly in the inside, it&#39;s
      like when you leave the pie out all night and it just become hard and I feel
      the taste was a bit off. The brisket and the pork ribs are full of flavors and
      very tender! Also they have the tangy mustard, spicy, and house sauce on the
      table. The services was great! They&#39;re very friendly even though they&#39;re

      Luckily for us today we swing in after 2p they close at 4p and they still had
      sliced lean brisket left. Since that&#39;s what this place is known for amongst
      other great foods and really what I wanted I was down with it. I got the 1lb
      sliced with a double portion of slaw. All I can say is WOW! This brisket hands
      down one of the best I have had. It was so juicy and the smoked ring and flavors
      were out of bounds. <br><br>What also really made this place 5 star from the

      phone to shoot a few shots of the smokers and he says &#34; come all the way

      of experience the guys asking where everyone was from and making great small

  - :body: I was aware of the warnings but didn&#39;t fully pay attention. Compared
      to my occasional 3pm weekend breakfasts, I was relatively diligent on my Little
      Miss BBQ excursion, but arriving just after the 11am opening time wasn&#39;t
      good enough. I waited about 1:40 and yet still didn&#39;t get the full experience,
      just missing the fatty brisket.<br><br>I got the lean brisket, chopped brisket
      and pork rib. The chopped was the best of these options, presumably hinting
      at some of the greatness of Little Miss BBQ&#39;s most elusive item. The beans
      were great and even the free pickles were good, and the pecan pie was a fine
      choice. I didn&#39;t get the pulled pork but it looked much more interesting
      than usual.

      if they were sold out of anything (they weren&#39;t), so we headed over. The

      the potato salad to be the best which surprised me because I usually don&#39;t
      love it. Their version is light on the sauce and doesn&#39;t have unnecessary
      additions like hard boiled eggs. Everything else wasn&#39;t bad but it was easy
      for me to save room for the meat! <br><br>The star of the show is definitely
      the meat. If I HAD to pick only two, I would probably do the brisket and sausage,
      but it would be quite sad if you couldn&#39;t try the ribs. There were three
      types of BBQ sauce on the table and I rotated between all of them, not able
      to land on a favorite because they were so good. Everything was tender and packed

      no matter how full you may be. It was super gooey and rich. Definitely beat

    :body: 'Why 5 stars? Because the journey was worth it.<br><br>   ---   ---   ---<br><br>After
      seeing Little Miss BBQ pop up as the #2 ranked restaurant in the country on
      Yelp in 2018, I immediately bookmarked it and knew that I would absolutely be
      visiting on an upcoming trip to the Phoenix area. I landed at the airport, got
      my rental car and drove straight there... only to see that the line was so long
      that it just wasn&#39;t conceivable that I&#39;d be able to wait. I had tickets
      to a spring training game and would have basically missed the whole game, which
      wasn&#39;t an option.<br><br>14 months later, I have another trip to Phoenix.
      I book an even earlier flight and clear my schedule for the entire day. Myself
      and a colleague arrive at 9:40a and are the first two people in line. Great
      success!<br><br>Because the aforementioned colleague and I perfectly align when
      it comes to these things, we basically picked out our favorite 4 meats and sides
      and shared everything. It&#39;s truly the only way to do Little Miss BBQ.<br><br>---MEATS---<br><br>Brisket:
      5-stars. We were given a sample when we walked up to the counter to order and
      it was absolute perfection. While it was a tad better fresh out of the foil
      than it was 20 minutes into our meal, this brisket was about as good as it gets.
      It would be hard to find someone who says otherwise.<br><br>Sausage: 4-stars.
      There was a certain kind of flavor with this sausage that I couldn&#39;t quite
      put my finger on. I enjoyed it very much and it was so juicy that it almost
      tasted like when I bit into it that a little water would come out, as weird
      as that sounds. If you like sausage, don&#39;t miss ordering this.<br><br>Pulled
      Pork: 5-stars. I feel like pulled pork has the least amount of variance of any
      BBQ meat, but they certainly didn&#39;t mess this up. If I had to come back
      for only two meats, this would be one of them, along with the brisket.<br><br>Pork
      Rib: 5-stars. I really can&#39;t complain about these ribs in any way. When
      you imagine having some delicious ribs, Little Miss BBQ pretty much serves you
      what you day dream about.<br><br>---SIDES---<br><br>Ranchero Beans: 3-stars.
      I think the issue might be more that I just don&#39;t love this kind of bean.
      They were fine, but I wouldn&#39;t order again.<br><br>Potato Salad: 5-stars.
      The star of the show with the sides, IMO. It was a bit unique from what I&#39;m
      used to with potato salad, in that the potatoes were diced into small cubes.
      I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen that before. But more importantly, the flavor
      was the ideal pairing for all the BBQ we had on our plates.<br><br>Coleslaw:
      3-stars. Pretty standard coleslaw - not bad, but not anything special.<br><br>Jalapeno
      Grits: 5-stars. Another great pairing to go along with all of the meat. If you&#39;re
      worried about this being spicy, throw those thoughts aside. I hate spicy foods
      and I didn&#39;t notice even a small kick.<br><br>---SAUCE---<br><br>Each table
      came with a bottle of standard, spicy and mustard sauce. I enjoyed all three
      of them. Just like with the grits, I didn&#39;t notice any kind of kick, so
      don&#39;t be shy to try it, even if you&#39;re not a fan of spicy things. I
      enjoyed all three sauces very much, but stuck mostly with the standard. 5-stars.<br><br>---CUSTOMER
      SERVICE---<br><br>An easy 5-stars. Every person we encountered wasn&#39;t just
      friendly, but ridiculously nice. I felt like I was at someone&#39;s house, rather
      than at a restaurant. And that&#39;s pretty impressive for a place to uphold
      that level of service when they have a line wrapped around the building every
      day.<br><br>It&#39;s no wonder that Little Miss BBQ has 2,000+ reviews and a
      5-star rating. It&#39;s virtually impossible to keep that up, but I get how
      these guys have done it - they are awesome all-around!'

      There was a certain kind of flavor with this sausage that I couldn&#39;t quite

      I think the issue might be more that I just don&#39;t love this kind of bean.
      They were fine, but I wouldn&#39;t order again.<br><br>Potato Salad: 5-stars.
      The star of the show with the sides, IMO. It was a bit unique from what I&#39;m
      used to with potato salad, in that the potatoes were diced into small cubes.
      I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen that before. But more importantly, the flavor

    :body: So we heard this place is the best BBQ in town and we decided to try it
      out. It opens at 11am and it was pretty hot and sunny day. We came around 10:30am
      before they open and we were shocked that the line was already long. The parking
      lot was a bit tight so we had to find parking then we waited in line. It was
      a hot day, but they&#39;re very thoughtful of putting the drinking water outside
      for everybody and they also have misters outside for us while waiting, it helps
      a lot especially around summer time. They have inside seatings as well, but
      it&#39;s pretty tight. <br><br>It was an hour and a half wait. When we got the
      food, it was already 12pm. We got the smoked brisket, the pork ribs, sausages,
      and the pecan pie. Everything was delicious except the pecan pie, surprisingly;
      because pecan pie is one of my favorite dessert, but I don&#39;t like the pecan
      pie here very much because it was hard on top but jelly in the inside, it&#39;s
      like when you leave the pie out all night and it just become hard and I feel
      the taste was a bit off. The brisket and the pork ribs are full of flavors and
      very tender! Also they have the tangy mustard, spicy, and house sauce on the
      table. The services was great! They&#39;re very friendly even though they&#39;re
      very busy, but still smile and greet customers and they work very fast to get
      orders. <br><br>I&#39;ve got to admit that the bbq was good, although I wish
      the place is a bit bigger so that customers have plenty of room to park and
      more room inside to sit and enjoy the food. I definitely would come back again,

    :body: BEST. BBQ. EVER. <br><br>Is it worth driving 1000s of miles? Is it worth
      waking up extra early just to stand in line? YES. YES. YES.<br><br>I&#39;m not
      even a huge fan of bbq, but after trying their smoked bbq....I was in love.
      <br><br>I arrived an hour before they opened and there was already a long line
      ahead of me. Once they opened the doors at 11AM, I only had to wait about 25-30
      minutes before I could order. If you want to make sure you get a taste of their
      delicious, mouthwatering, knee-shaking meat, then I suggest you arrive 1.5 hours
      ahead of time. Their main selection of meat was almost out by the time I ordered.
      Their pecan pie is also rich, creamy, and tasty. You&#39;ll be asking for more
      on your first bite. <br><br>The service is phenomenal. The staff members are
      welcoming and cheerful. They even gave us a few samples too!

      put it around a 3.5. The bbq overall is pretty good, but it isn&#39;t somewhere
      I would frequent due to the amount of time spent waiting outside.<br><br>Favorites
      - fatty brisket, pastrami, pecan pie. The brisket really does melt in your mouth
      and is some of the best I&#39;ve had, although can be a bit salty. The pecan
      pie has a perfectly flaky crust, and the pie is not overly sweet and has great
      flavor. <br><br>Others - pastrami has great flavor but is a bit dry  lean brisket
      is fine, but definitely needs some sauce as it is also dry. Pork ribs were fine
      but salty, and I didn&#39;t want to eat more than one. Sausage is also fine
      but nothing special, and wouldn&#39;t order again. <br><br>As for sides, the
      potato salad is fresh and delicious. The jalapeño cheddar grits are also good
      but pretty standard. And the beans were creamy and rich. <br><br>Overall, the
      bbq was good but I&#39;d really only come back for the fatty brisket and pecan

      to my occasional 3pm weekend breakfasts, I was relatively diligent on my Little
      Miss BBQ excursion, but arriving just after the 11am opening time wasn&#39;t
      good enough. I waited about 1:40 and yet still didn&#39;t get the full experience,
      just missing the fatty brisket.<br><br>I got the lean brisket, chopped brisket
      and pork rib. The chopped was the best of these options, presumably hinting
      at some of the greatness of Little Miss BBQ&#39;s most elusive item. The beans
      were great and even the free pickles were good, and the pecan pie was a fine
      choice. I didn&#39;t get the pulled pork but it looked much more interesting
      than usual.

      my gf and I just had a one-off experience but it was no bueno. We had the Di
      Notte pizza and there was wayyyyyyyyyyy too much Gorgonzola in it. Couldn&#39;t
      taste anything else except that. $17 pizza and I had half a slice.<br><br>Also
      got the Friday special which was a truffle ravioli... it actually was pretty
      good, BUT, came out cold- which for $18 is absurd. All that said, the Nutella
      crepes were pretty good which is why I&#39;m giving this 2 stars. <br><br>All
      in all, I will not be returning. Simply for the fact that I know numerous pizza
      places in the valley that I can spend $30 less and get 30x better pizza.

  - :body: Not going to lie, I was a little disappointed with my Cibo experience.
      I had super high expectations though so that might have been part of the issue.
      It is really cute in here! I love the aesthetic. I liked the grape vines outside!
      It&#39;s very cute here. So I have always wanted to try arancini so we got that
      to start. I am a vegetarian so I thought it was helpful that they mark everything
      that is vegetarian. Or so I thought..saw that the arancini was vegetarian and
      it was supposed to be a fried rice ball with cheese. The server brings it out
      and says ok here&#39;s your arancini! We also added beef and peas! I am grateful
      she said something..but ew. I wanted a rice ball with cheese like the menu said.
      Not beef and peas. She didn&#39;t ask us if that was ok. So I asked her if we
      could just have cheese ones and she said yes but they all are going to have
      peas. The peas are not like ground up and mixed in so I didn&#39;t really understand
      that. I was thankful she got us new ones though, that was nice. They didn&#39;t
      taste good though, they were way too fried and the peas felt out of place. For
      my meal I ordered a sandwich that had mint, arugula, tomatoes, and cheese on
      it with a side salad. I liked the salad! The sandwich was alright, the mint
      taste was a little too much for me. I loved the bread though! My boyfriend got
      a margherita pizza without basil. The crust and cheese were delicious! I thought
      the sauce was gross though. Both on the pizza and on the side to dip the arancini
      in. It tastes like it&#39;s straight from the can, that metallic-y taste. I
      personally did not like it. Our service was not too bad. Not the best ever,
      but not bad. I would give this place a second try but I think I&#39;d need to
      order something different off the menu, not involving tomato sauce.

       The pizza is wood fired and full of flavor!<br><br>To start off, we ordered
      the cheesy rice balls as well as the burratta-- both were excellent.  The burratta
      comes on a bed of cherry tomatoes, with about 5 pieces of toasted bread.  At
      first it seems like little but there is plenty to go around.  Same goes with
      the rice balls-- 5 are in an order, which is plenty.<br><br>We ordered the margarita

      <br><br>-Tartufata Pizza (5/5)<br>I saw that a lot of people ordered this white
      pizza so why not.  It comes with mozzarella, prosciutto, white mushrooms and

      cover and fresh tuna bite along with imitation crab.  It was drizzled with chipotle
      mustard giving it a spicy kick.  As for the Ahi Tower, it was a mound of their
      signature purple rice along with Ahi Tuna and topped with Tobiko and imitation
      crab.  This took me a while to eat, but it was definitely worth your while if
      you&#39;re into quantity.  I barely finished it off myself, but had to suck

      raw delight is well received! - Enjoy!"

      the dinner rush but not get there too late to piss off the kitchen staff. As
      I walked up I noticed the place was packed. Literally, there was a line out
      the door. Luckily the line was made up of parties larger than 2 so I walked
      up and they sat me at the only open table in the place, a 2 top by the door.<br><br>I
      ended up ordering a seaweed salad and the 5 Nigiri + Crazy Roll. The seaweed
      salad made it out pretty quick. It was your standard seaweed salad served in
      a bowl over a small bed of daikon. When the entree came out I was caught off
      guard as the Crazy Roll had purple rice. I&#39;d never seen that before. I took
      a quick peak around the restaurant and everyone that had rolls with rice had
      purple on their plate. I don&#39;t think they serve white rice. It wasn&#39;t
      an issue; just a little change from the norm. After the fact, I noticed a small
      TV above the host stand that had a rotating video calling it Forbidden Rice.
      I did a little research and apparently Forbidden/Black rice is better for you
      then brown rice and is low-gluten. The nigiri and the crazy roll were excellent.<br><br>I
      was a little weary of sushi in Phoenix but this was pretty good. Next time I&#39;m

      though. <br><br>Good stuff:<br><br>Boy, oh boy, is this extremely delicious
      sushi. You can tell they use high-quality ingredients by the flavor and texture.
      My favorite dish of the night was the Super Crunch Shrimp. Wow. The breading
      was so crispy and just a touch sweet. The roll never fell apart even when I
      ate one piece a few bites at a time. I also ordered the Las Vegas roll, which
      was alright. I believe it was deep-fried, had cream cheese, jalapeños, and crab.
      And lastly, we ordered salmon sashimi. They gave us fat-ass, 1.5-inch slices
      of salmon. Just scrumptious. <br><br>Bad stuff:<br><br>The worst service. Although
      they seemed to be fully staffed, the servers still looked very overwhelmed.
      My girlfriend and I both ordered hot tea. A male server brought it to us, warning
      us it was hot. He was very shakey and spilled the hot tea he warned us about
      over my thighs. Thank goodness I was wearing shorts and his warning was inaccurate--the
      tea was warm, not hot. I know the restaurant was busy, but we shouldn&#39;t
      have to ask for utensils or napkins. We did. They also barely checked on us
      and we had to wave down associates to get even the slightest attention. <br><br>Truth
      be told, I&#39;d come back and even recommend to a friend. But, try to be more
      attentive and aware when it comes to customer service, please.

  - :body: A rare combo of really delicious food and over the top service.  I came
      on an early Friday evening and their system had just crashed as we arrived.
       Before they sat us they explained the situation, apologized for the inconvenience,
      but said they would serve us drinks on the house if we wanted to wait.<br><br>Quite
      an offer, so we sat and ordered a Mexican coke (it&#39;s a big bottle) and prickly
      pear margarita on the rocks (delicious).  10 min later they said we could order
      appetizers so we got the &#34;Trio&#34; which comes with Oaxaca fundido, home
      made guac, and chips with salsa and hot sauce.  All were good, but the Oaxaca
      fundido was out of this world!<br><br>Next, they said we could order an entree
      if we had cash, as their system was still down.  We split 3 tacos, one fish,
      one al pastor, and one beef tenderloin.  All were fantastic and it&#39;s hard
      to pick one over another but I was told the tenderloin is their most popular
      one.  <br><br>Upon finishing we asked for the check, but after our server spoke
      with the manager/owner they said it was on the house!  We were pretty insistent
      on paying as we had cash, but they were adamant.  On the way out the manager/owner
      apologized again and only asked that we come back again.  Needless to say we
      plan on making this place a regular spot of ours!

  - :body: After reading a Review of the Day on Cocina Madrigal, I had to give it
      a try! My family and I absolutely loved it! The waitress recommended the grilled
      pineapple guacamole, it was delicious! Next time I&#39;m going to ask if they
      can make it spicy, but it&#39;s really good the way it comes too! (I just like
      spicy guacamole!.) we did ask for some lime wedges, and after a few squeezes
      and some additional salt, that seemed to bring it to life, and really help accent
      the grilled pineapple!  You&#39;ll also need to order chips and salsa, theses
      do not come complimentary to your table. However, I&#39;m a chip and salsa girl,
      and the chips are thin and crispy with the right amount of salt, and the salsa
      is AMAZING!! Spicy and flavorful! Do order both these appetizers! <br><br>We
      all got house margaritas, they were perfectly balanced,and delightful! Love
      a good margarita! <br><br>We ordered the grilled Elote&#39; it was fully dressed
      with all the goodies that grilled street corn should have! They offer it on
      the cob, and off!, we tried both ways! Both equally good, just a personal preference
      how you like to eat it. <br><br>For our entrees, our party ordered; chicken
      pasta, chicken enchiladas, steak burrito, and wild mushroom enchilada and a
      beef enchilada! If you remotely &#34;like&#34; mushrooms, this is a must! It
      was so tasty! All the entrees were flavorful and above average, the beans and
      rice, was some of the best I&#39;ve had! I usually treat these two items as
      a garnish, and never touch it, but not here! The rice and beans are definitely
      house made, and so darn good! We all enjoyed everything! <br><br>Service was
      also above average, we were constantly checked on, taking more drink orders,
      or filling up our water, nothing got left unnoticed, even though this place
      was packed! (They do take reservations, so take advantage of that!) because
      this place is hopping! <br><br>I will be back!!! Probably too much, this place

      were skeptical because this place is a little hole in the wall but I&#39;m so
      glad we gave it a chance! We were greeted immediately as we walked in and seated
      right away. It&#39;s a pretty small restaurant with a good vibe and great, friendly
      service. Our server, Jenny, was really sweet and gave us great recommendations
      for food and drinks!<br><br>We ordered the bacon jalapeño guacamole (they have
      various flavors of guacamole to choose from). It was very fresh and delicious
      with the spicy salsa and warm chips. We also ordered the tacos (you pick 3 tacos
      with a side of rice and beans); we got a fish taco, el pastor taco and steak
      taco. They were all delicious, fresh and full of meat/toppings but the steak
      was hands down the best! The steak is so tender and flavorful and the fried
      onions and peppers on top are the perfect crunch. It was melt in your mouth,
      moan while you eat it good. <br><br>We also ordered the churros for dessert
      after we saw every single table in the restaurant with them, we couldn&#39;t
      resist! They are unlike any other churro. They are filled with custard and drizzled
      in caramel. I highly recommend them! <br><br>We&#39;ll be back for the steak
      tacos for sure!

  - :body: The destination can be daunting. It is South Phoenix, after all.<br><br>We
      came because I had friends hyping this place almost every day. I had to see
      what the big deal was.<br><br>We were seated by Raudel at a table in the center
      of the action.  Their menu is small, but still has a good selection of dishes.
      We came with big appetites and they were steering our eyes and our mouths when
      we made our orders.<br><br>As such, we had to take home most of our dinner!<br><br>We
      started out with the homemade guacamole, the fundido, and their chips and salsa.
      The chips are crisp and well textured. They make them from scratch in the restaurant.
      The salsa has a nice bite, but it&#39;s not too fiery. We liked it a lot, but
      I&#39;m partial to the salsa at La Pinata.  I don&#39;t have enough raves for
      the guacamole. I don&#39;t even like guacamole, but I scooped this up greedily.
      I believe they might have put something addictive into the mixture. My favorite
      from the appetizers had to be the Fundido. It&#39;s generous enough to be a
      meal.  It has smokey bits of sausages in a spicy chili sauce with enough cheese
      to daunt anyone with even the slightest hint of lactose intolerance. <br><br>The
      main dishes were outstanding. The steak in the burro was marinated and although
      tender tasted as though it had been grilled slightly. The marinade had a tangy
      bit of flavor to it. It really was enjoyable, as were the beans and rice. I
      don&#39;t normally like having a side of beans, but this restaurant does them
      correctly. The enchiladas were also a hit with me.<br><br>The only disappointment
      is that they don&#39;t serve flan. What! No Flan?!<br><br> The highlight of
      the evening was having Chef Leo come out and talk to me. He shook both our hands
       and spent a long time talking to us. He chatted about his background. He grew
      his love for cooking by watching his grandmother. He grew his experience through
      his various to travels which included Mexico City and Houston. A couple years
      ago he started this restaurant and he felt very blessed that it was so well

      and my husband suggest this place! OMG! I&#39;m so glad he did! This place is
      amazing! It doesn&#39;t look like much on the outside, but the inside is cute
      and quaint. But enough about that, let&#39;s talk about the food and service!
      I got the green chil enchiladas and they were outstanding! My husband had the
      fish tacos and he couldn&#39;t stop talking about them! All 8 of us thoroughly
      enjoyed our food and the service was stellar! Can&#39;t wait to go back!

  - :body: 4.5/5<br><br>Cocina Madrigal is cocina magical! This restaurant isn&#39;t
      in the most scenic nor magical part of town but the flavors and service here
      make up for the lack of neighborhood ambiance.<br><br>Reservations were easy
      to make on Yelp and we were seated right away when we got here. It was a bit
      too warm for me initially in the restaurant but I got used to it after a while.
      <br><br>The cuisine here is probably best described as Nuevo Latino, with unique
      twists on some Mexican food classics. The menu offers tacos, burritos, enchiladas,
      and various entree platters. <br><br>We started off with an incredible guacamole
      with salsa and chips. Usually when I have guacamole at a restaurant that touts
      itself as being made fresh to order at your table it&#39;s good, but nothing
      so special that I couldn&#39;t make it at home, but this guac had a nuanced
      depth of flavor that I absolutely loved. Whatever that special ingredient is,
      keep it coming it&#39;s so spectacular! It was served with a mountain of chips
      with a bowl of salsa. This was a good sized amount of guacamole too by the way,
      so well worth your money.<br><br>I was intrigued by the grilled romaine salad
      so I opted for that as my main dish with steak tenderloin. This was my first
      time having a grilled romaine salad and it won&#39;t be my last! I loved that
      grilled mesquite flavor permeating through the lettuce and it was cooked just
      enough that the lettuce still retained its crispness. The steak was very tender,
      well seasoned, and an ample portion. <br><br>I had a bite of the churros for
      dessert, and it was a fabulously heavenly bite! They were nice and warm with
      a custard center and the dipping sauce was amazing. <br><br>What also really
      sets this restaurant apart is the superb service. Drinks were refilled constantly,
      our server was excellent and the chef came by our table to make sure everything
      was OK. I really appreciate all the care that he places to make sure the diners
      at his restaurant are having the best experience possible.

      a try! My family and I absolutely loved it! The waitress recommended the grilled
      pineapple guacamole, it was delicious! Next time I&#39;m going to ask if they
      can make it spicy, but it&#39;s really good the way it comes too! (I just like
      spicy guacamole!.) we did ask for some lime wedges, and after a few squeezes
      and some additional salt, that seemed to bring it to life, and really help accent
      the grilled pineapple!  You&#39;ll also need to order chips and salsa, theses
      do not come complimentary to your table. However, I&#39;m a chip and salsa girl,
      and the chips are thin and crispy with the right amount of salt, and the salsa
      is AMAZING!! Spicy and flavorful! Do order both these appetizers! <br><br>We
      all got house margaritas, they were perfectly balanced,and delightful! Love
      a good margarita! <br><br>We ordered the grilled Elote&#39; it was fully dressed
      with all the goodies that grilled street corn should have! They offer it on
      the cob, and off!, we tried both ways! Both equally good, just a personal preference
      how you like to eat it. <br><br>For our entrees, our party ordered; chicken
      pasta, chicken enchiladas, steak burrito, and wild mushroom enchilada and a
      beef enchilada! If you remotely &#34;like&#34; mushrooms, this is a must! It
      was so tasty! All the entrees were flavorful and above average, the beans and
      rice, was some of the best I&#39;ve had! I usually treat these two items as
      a garnish, and never touch it, but not here! The rice and beans are definitely
      house made, and so darn good! We all enjoyed everything! <br><br>Service was
      also above average, we were constantly checked on, taking more drink orders,
      or filling up our water, nothing got left unnoticed, even though this place
      was packed! (They do take reservations, so take advantage of that!) because

      <br><br>I, on the other hand, think Chef Leo is a genius and we&#39;ll be back.
      He told me that he will put flan on the menu since so many have asked for it
      and to make sure to call him in advance to see if it&#39;s available.

    :body: 4.5/5<br><br>Cocina Madrigal is cocina magical! This restaurant isn&#39;t
      in the most scenic nor magical part of town but the flavors and service here
      make up for the lack of neighborhood ambiance.<br><br>Reservations were easy
      to make on Yelp and we were seated right away when we got here. It was a bit
      too warm for me initially in the restaurant but I got used to it after a while.
      <br><br>The cuisine here is probably best described as Nuevo Latino, with unique
      twists on some Mexican food classics. The menu offers tacos, burritos, enchiladas,
      and various entree platters. <br><br>We started off with an incredible guacamole
      with salsa and chips. Usually when I have guacamole at a restaurant that touts
      itself as being made fresh to order at your table it&#39;s good, but nothing
      so special that I couldn&#39;t make it at home, but this guac had a nuanced
      depth of flavor that I absolutely loved. Whatever that special ingredient is,
      keep it coming it&#39;s so spectacular! It was served with a mountain of chips
      with a bowl of salsa. This was a good sized amount of guacamole too by the way,
      so well worth your money.<br><br>I was intrigued by the grilled romaine salad
      so I opted for that as my main dish with steak tenderloin. This was my first
      time having a grilled romaine salad and it won&#39;t be my last! I loved that
      grilled mesquite flavor permeating through the lettuce and it was cooked just
      enough that the lettuce still retained its crispness. The steak was very tender,
      well seasoned, and an ample portion. <br><br>I had a bite of the churros for
      dessert, and it was a fabulously heavenly bite! They were nice and warm with
      a custard center and the dipping sauce was amazing. <br><br>What also really
      sets this restaurant apart is the superb service. Drinks were refilled constantly,
      our server was excellent and the chef came by our table to make sure everything
      was OK. I really appreciate all the care that he places to make sure the diners
      at his restaurant are having the best experience possible.

      the famous ice cream donuts across the board. I got the cookie monster ice cream
      with sprinkles and was not disappointed. It had a classic cookies and cream
      flavor and a great texture overall - aka no icicles or crunchy bits. I also
      loved that they didn&#39;t skimp on toppings; I definitely had a ton of sprinkles
      on my ice cream~ <br><br>Service is extremely friendly as is the owner of the
      store. Parking can be hard within their own lot, but you should be able to find
      street parking nearby pretty easily! The biggest downside for me here was the
      lack of indoor seating or even some sort of fan outside. It was a summer day
      in PHX so it was in the 90s even at 8/9 pm and it was completely unrelenting.

      being 5 stars. it&#39;s AWESOME SAUCE!<br><br>our family stopped by novel ice
      cream while we were in phoenix for a weekend vacation. some places have a lot
      of hype, but don&#39;t deliver... that is not the case with novel ice cream.
      <br><br>it&#39;s located in and among some others stores, restaurants, bars.
      the shop is pretty small with no indoor seating, but there are plenty of outside
      seating. there&#39;s even a park down the street as well. <br><br>the parking
      on site is limited, but we just drove down the street a few blocks and was able
      to find street parking. after a short walk we arrived. since it was around 6:30p
      on a weeknight the line was pretty short. i bet it&#39;s much longer on the
      weekend and later in the evening. <br><br>they offered us all the samples we
      wanted and we took them up on their offer. the owner was there and super helpful
      in explaining the different flavors and all the ingredients in them. they&#39;ve
      won multiple awards for their ice cream. we make ice cream at home and they&#39;ve
      inspired me to up my game. my kids ended up choosing the cookie monster and
      butter pecan. i got the dough melt (ice cream sandwiched between a warm glazed
      donut) with their award winning chocolate. i forgot what my wife ordered, but
      she loved it.  <br><br>the price point is higher than you&#39;re going to pay
      at thrifty&#39;s or mc donalds, but the quality is so much higher, it&#39;s
      not even fair to compare. there was definitely the standard sugar rush and subsequent
      crash, but we loved this place. i asked them to open a store in tucson, but
      maybe it&#39;s a good thing they haven&#39;t done that quite yet.

  - :body: Being originally from the Midwest, I had no idea Mexican food could be
      so dynamic and delicious. La Santisima was suggested to me by a coworker who
      lives locally.<br><br>My wife and I try and visit La Santisima weekly and are
      working through their humongous menu. Every thing we have ordered was delicious
      and the customer service was great.<br><br>The Oaxacan Black Mole Burro and
      Quesa has been one of my favorite entrees here along with the Queso appetizer.

      next beat tacos. My boyfriend and I get there and immediately noticed the great
      interior design of the place. Really well put together. We get seated and noticed
      that there was a little salsa station. We picked ourselves most of the salsas
      they were serving. Honestly, they were good but not the best. <br>After 10-12
      minutes of waiting for someone to take our drink order, a waitress comes. She
      later comes back with our drinks. We yet again had to wait a little longer to
      place our order. We finally ordered our food. 15mins go by.. 25... 30... 40...
      honestly that&#39;s the last time I checked the clock! We were getting so impatient.
      If it wasn&#39;t because we had eaten chips we would have been more hangry.
      Mind you it&#39;s the 1st time she had check up on us after an hour of being
      there. My boyfriend wanted another drink but our waitress was nowhere to be
      seen for most of the time we were there she would pass our tables but not acknowledge
      us at all. <br>For the 1st time after she took our food order, god knows how
      many minutes later she comes and checks up on us<br>She then comes to tell us
      that something had happened to her their ticket machine and I guess the cook
      never got it because the machine was jammed. She gave my boyfriend a beer on
      the house. Three minutes after that, we finally get out food!! I mean the food
      was good, it was actually really good and we enjoyed our plate I&#39;m not gonna
      lie we thought it would be bigger portions but it&#39;s OK. I was just really
      upset at the service we got. <br>Not gonna lie, I went to the bathroom it was
       pretty dirty there was toilet paper on the floor, you could tell they haven&#39;t
      been cleaned in a couple hours and there wasn&#39;t that many people in the
      restaurant so I don&#39;t know how many hours it had been since the last clean.<br>The
      menu was a little overwhelming. <br>The 2 stars are for the food and design
      of the place.

      solely based on review count. <br>Left a little underwhelmed. This place was
      covered by Guy Fieri and that raised my expectations a few notch. <br>The gourmet
      tacos were nothing special. My group had the fish, shark and chicken tacos.
      And none of the 3 stood out. The salsa bar had over a dozen salsa variations
      and most of them were good. However, the disposable cups were too small. Ended
      up making several annoying trips to the salsa bar. Recommend the peanut salsa.
      I had the La Condesa Shrimp burro. It was good. The guac was also pretty good.

      I ordered two different shrimp tacos and the roasted squash and was completely
      satisfied with my choices. My friend ordered one of the quesadillas and took
      half of it home to enjoy later since they are quite large! She&#39;s been here
      before and knew what she was getting into so she planned to eat half for lunch
      and have half for dinner. <br><br>The chips are super fresh and delicious with
      the right amount of salt and the salsa/condiments bar is AMAZING! My favorite
      is the salsa verde. I think i had four servings of that because it&#39;s so
      darn good! <br><br>Additionally, their service is amazing! The guy up front
      could tell I hadn&#39;t been in before so he made some recommendations and checked

      that make you keep coming back for more! First off the coffee is delicious!
      They have good options for those who like sugary decadent creations, and the
      taste of their coffee speaks for itself. <br><br>The service is always smiling
      and quick. Rarely is there anything wrong with the quality and if there is they
      are quick to fix it. <br><br>The atmosphere is fun and perfect for a coffee
      shop. If you like finding hidden nooks for reading or sitting with a group of
      people you don&#39;t know they have places for both!<br><br>They also have a

      more room to serve everyone in the a/c, but the car was half the reason I wanted
      to visit again. <br><br>My boyfriend loved that they had jackfruit. Getting
      to eat something that isn&#39;t some pretend meat was great for him. His sandwich
      was kind of spicy and tangy from the slaw. Very tasty.<br><br>I had the Bumble
      Bee and... meh. I would have preferred it be open faced. Just slice a biscuit
      in half, smear mustard on it, drizzle honey, top with chicken, little more honey,
      and pickles. It&#39;ll take up more of the plate and trick me into thinking
      I got my money&#39;s worth. Served as is, I didn&#39;t get nearly enough honey.

      we heard about it opening. This place has great atmosphere and has an old school
      diner feel with a relaxed vibe. We tried one of the chicken biscuit sandwiches
      recommended to us with the gravy on the side. The chicken was cooked perfectly
      and was so good. The gravy had awesome flavor, but the bacon was ok it was too
      tough which made it hard to eat with the sandwich. The burger had jalapeños
      and it was one of the best burgers we&#39;ve had. Then we had to try the Mac
      and cheese which is my favorite, and this is a 9 out of 10 for me. This place
      is amazing, the service was great and we will definitely be back.

      which is topped with fried chicken and gravy. The gravy was just okay, there
      wasn&#39;t enough of it. The chicken was seemed like it was prepared ahead of
      time. I get that fried chicken is hard but made to order is always best. We
      also order the Mac and cheese. I appreciated that it wasn&#39;t too cheesy or
      overly rich. But something was funky with the taste. My companion had a totally
      different take on the food though. He loved it all!

      nice cool spot in the summer! But welcome diner has exceeded my expectations.
      First they not only have a chicken biscuit, but it is smothered and covered
      in a creamy sausage gravy. Can you say I&#39;ll take several? This meal definitely
      requires fork and knife and maybe even a partner to share it with. Although
      the chicken was covered in gravy, it still remained a bit crispy and was definitely
      juicy. I saw grits on the menu and also decided I needed those. They are made
      with pimento cheese. OMG. They were cheesy and creamy, everything grits should
      be. They come in a small cup but if they offered a large bowl I would gladly
      choose that size as they were pretty tasty. Besides the delicious food the employees
      were friendly and the neighborhood is pretty hip. There is street parking and
      plenty of it which is always nice.

  - :body: What&#39;s to say that hasn&#39;t already been said?<br><br>One of the
      best meals in recent memory. Lot&#39;s of vegetarian choices for my wife. The
      type of eating that we like to do... sample a large variety of plates. Great
      drinks, desserts, and the best company. Service was fantastic and attentive.<br><br>The
      food was amazing. Ripping bread apart with your hands and picking up bits of
      hummus and pickles is right up our alley. By the time we got to the Al Ha&#39;esh
      course in the tasting menu, we were already full. But we powered through amazing
      lamb, fish, and steak. Then we sampled all of the desserts. Great and interesting
      choices of flavors.<br><br>If you go as a party of four, and you choose the
      &#34;Taste of Zahav&#34; tasting menu, you can almost have the entire menu in
      one sitting.<br><br>I have tried on numerous occasion to get a weekend reservation
      to Zahav with no avail. Counting the days to when the girls would be visiting,
      I put a calendar reminder to make a reservation a couple of months in advance
      and it worked. Later slot than we would have originally wanted, but willing
      to drive the hour plus to get here.<br><br>A friend who had just eaten here
      the week prior gave me tips for parking. We opted for the discount valet across
      the street at the Marriott Old City (formerly Sheraton).<br><br>The family loved
      the meal so much, we&#39;re already plotting to come back in the winter.

  - :body: 'RESERVATIONS + FIRST IMPRESSIONS:<br>One of the best places to go in Philly.
      Almost impossible to get a reservation here, but I actually was able to get
      one after checking back a few times over the course of a week. Eventually, something
      opened, and it was 1-2 months away so I grabbed it. You can do a walk-in, but
      be prepared to wait or come when they open. Anyway, I expected the restaurant
      to be bigger but it&#39;s actually not too big, it had a long bar and bar seating
      next to their slightly open kitchen. You can see the action from afar, but it
      must be awesome watching the chefs do their magic. <br><br>AMBIANCE:<br>It&#39;s
      dim, but not overly dim. You can see the menu perfectly without needing to turn
      on your phone&#39;s flashlight. It&#39;s warm, cozy, but trendy and the vibe
      is buzzing. We came on a weekday evening and it was packed. It gets loud, but
      that&#39;s expected. <br><br>FOOD:<br>The highlight of why you come to Zahav,
      obviously: the food. I have watched a documentary on the Chef, and he knows
      his stuff about Israeli cuisine. Having been to the country, the food here still
      blew my socks off. It&#39;s delicious and authentic. The only downside is the
      two dishes people raved about and the two I wanted to try (Pomegranate lamb
      shoulder and chocolate konafi dessert) are only available with the tasting menu.
      So, that means, not the tasting menu on the actual menu, but the one your server
      will offer, or you will ask for. It&#39;s pricey, at 66$ per person, but so
      worth it to try once. The lamb shoulder and chocolate Konafi were the two standouts
      of the night, and I will be dreaming about these dishes until I am back. <br><br>SERVICE:<br>Service
      was on point, attentive, but could have been improved a bit. I think it got
      confusing in the beginning because the server who took our drink orders wasn&#39;t
      our actual server. Our server was a touch snobby (you know, the hipster vibe
      type of snobby) but we didn&#39;t think much of it. I think there is room for
      improvement in this category, but my standards are high so overall I would say
      5/5<br><br>OVERALL<br>One of Philly&#39;s best restaurants, and one of the best
      restaurants I have been to (I go to A LOT). Highly recommend coming here- and
      get the chef&#39;s tasting on a special occasion.'

      because it&#39;s so hard to make a reservation! Definitely worth the very long
      wait! I have taken multiple people here, for birthdays or other special occasions,
      and everyone is still impressed even after I&#39;ve talked their ear off about
      the amazing menu.<br>Try everything! Do the chef&#39;s tasting, it&#39;s worth
      it.<br>Pretty sure the bar is first come first serve too, so if you show up
      around 4:30 and put your name in before they open and can spare a half hour,
      it&#39;ll be worth it.

      nearly impossible to book Zahav or just a cluster of old stodgy buildings if
      you can&#39;t find it. Outside, its an old revolutionary historic building.
      Inside, it&#39;s truly revolutionary and making history. <br><br>Zahav is a
      large box with a soaring ceiling anchored by a large visible crankin&#39; kitchen
      behind a glass wall with a counter attached. Sit there and you are separated
      from everything like the border at Gaza. You&#39;ll feel like a pound puppy
      furtively searching for your forever home...forever. Better to sit at a table.<br><br>Opposite
      the kitchen is a packed Bar. The middle of the room is jammed with 2 tops, a
      small communal table for small convivial diners, and a hidden alcove for A-Listers
      and family only Bar Mitzvahs. Also great for that first/last date.  <br><br>Come
      early for your reservation, no problem, but also, be advised, you won&#39;t
      be seated. A Hostess finger will point to the Bar 4 deep with Philly&#39;s finest.
      Make a nest on one of the 2 tired ottomans called &#34;The Lounge&#34; no bigger
      than the  back seat of a Ford Fiesta.  <br><br>You might get a drink. You might
      not, depending on if you&#39;re noticed.Time to slip on that Trout Mask to get
      attention. Then, if you&#39;re actually served, go ahead, try to balance the
      drink and take that selfie. Mazel tov. <br><br>It&#39;s loud. It&#39;s pushy.
      It&#39;s overbearing. It&#39;s growing up in a Jewish household with better
      food and set to music. Speaking of, mercifully, here, there was no Middle Eastern
      electro-loop to compete with and no sweaty, zaftig belly dancer undulating her
      pelvis in a lustful manner with her Pirelli P-7 flowing over her harem pants
      to annoy everyone. Just the deafening sounds of happy diners happily dining.
              <br><br>The Staff: A lot of milling and mingling. (With each other).
      No one answers the phone. No one has an answer, (okay, everyone has an answer,
      just not the right one). Although Liz, The Good Fairy, answered my plaintive
      cross country call/e-mail/text and navigated both of us through the silly on-line
      booking algorithm. A robot asks if you are a robot. Trolling for a cyber hook
      up? <br><br>Then there was Lady Leah, who orchestrated my dinner and cared for
      me  like a Jewish Mother. Toda. <br><br>The Bar: No spirits barred plus Israeli
      wine. (Let&#39;s call this whining and dining). Hey, I bought wine made in Paducah,
      Ky, so Israeli wine wasn&#39;t a giant leap. <br><br>I started with a Tiki in
      the Tigres. It was the Arab Spring in a high ball glass. It had Rum, Batavia
      Arrack, Amba, (pickled Mango) Strawberry, Lime and Orange which made it vaguely
      citrusy along with a Cinnamon note. Likeable for sure. Alas, my Side Car derailed.
      It was made with a packet of Cascade and was basically undrinkable. I left it
      untouched on   the ottoman. <br><br>Oops, someone found the the stereo and dialed
      up the beat as if it was time for enhanced interrogation. <br><br>The Vibe:
      Who&#39;s in the house? High achievers, Tel Avivers, ex-pat Sabras, table runners
      who know a few English palabras, just finished shoppers and office hoppers.
      A fondue of who&#39;s who.   <br><br>The Food: Brilliant. It was everything
      and more than expected. To start try the Tray of Relish. You&#39;ll relish that.<br><br>The
      Salatim was a rotating 6 salad offering. Mine was Eggplant two ways, creamy
      and chunky, Moroccan Carrots, Sweet Red Bells, Shredded Fennel Cabbage (think
      Jewish Kimchee), and Hot Cherry Pepper. Each one a delight. <br><br>Next, you&#39;ll
      get the legendary Hummus, (the best this side of Bavel in LA). The topping du
      jour was roasted Corn and Shishito Peppers. Even neat this Hummus is hard to
      beat. <br><br>The Set Menu is the best bet and provides 2 Mezze to mess with.
      One was Fried Cauliflower on a bed of Mint, Lemon, and Aleppo Pepper Aioli.
      Tasty even though the Cauliflower had steamed away it&#39;s fryer crunch. <br><br>The
      Kibbe Naya was regal. Raw Lamb. Are you nodding no? Great, more for me. It was
      texturally intriguing and delicious. Bulghur Cracked Wheat, Spring Garlic, and
      crisp Maitaiko Mushrooms. This was baaa&#39;d to the bone, baby. <br><br>The
      Halloumi was hot and cheesy which also describes the perfect date to take home
      to your Jewish parents. Camera ready? Both were tasty morsels, indeed. <br><br>The
      Kitchen spiffed me a Smoked Snapper in a Cabbage Leaf. Leaf that here all for
      me, please. <br><br>A Beef Kebab was wonderful. It was half the size of an Oscar
      Meyer Wiener and had me beggin&#39; for the whole grill load of them. <br><br>The
      Chicken Shashlik was everything a Chicken dish could and should be. A bucket
      of those nuggets would have been pure gold. Any idea of the street value? <br><br>Wanna
      have peace in the Middle East by the weekend? Invite Hamas to  eat here. <br><br>Lastly,
      a Malabi (Israeli Milk Pudding) Strawberry (Fruit &#39;n Flan) with Rose, and
      Hazelnut Crumble was both light and rich at the same time.<br><br>The Olive
      Oil Cake with Passionfruit pieces and Whipped Labneh made me, of little faith,
      nervous, but this was truly terrific and a fine ending to a marvelous meal.

  - :body: After living in Philly for 4 years and considering myself a self-proclaimed
      &#34;foodie&#34;, this dining experience was long anticipated. My sister in
      law made a reservation 2 months in advance, waiting up until midnight to snag
      an 8pm reservation last night for my father&#39;s birthday. Zahav was so kind
      to print a personalized happy birthday message on the menu, which my father
      thought was cool and kept a menu for himself.<br><br>We had a party of 6 and
      opted for the tasting menu. The waitstaff was very attentive, thorough, and
      explained the dishes as they were coming out. For the table, we got two orders
      of the salatim (six vegetable salads) and to my surprise, the cabbage was my
      favorite! I could eat bowls of it!<br><br>Next we got to choose two hummus dishes,
      in which we chose the Turkish (served warm) - this tasted like mashed potatoes
      - consistency and all. But I enjoyed it nonetheless. The other hummus we chose
      was the tehina, which was tasty, but it was more of a &#34;typical&#34; hummus
      has there was no special twist or flavoring. The laffa was fresh, hot, and aplenty.
      They brought us out a third laffa upon request.<br><br>Ah, then the mezze course.
      Each of us got to choose two, so we ended up with 12 mezze. Now these plates
      are small but 12 was a LOT. My favorites were the amba pickled egg and the kibbe
      naya. My family really seemed to like the grilled haloumi. I even tried a duck
      heart, which was new for me!<br><br>By this point we were FULL but had two courses
      left! Each of us chose an entree, but we doubled up on the hanger steak and
      opted out of the mushroom. Each kebab was just big enough for each of us to
      have about 2-3 bites. The bronzino was cooked perfectly and very flavorful -
      my favorite part was the fresh tzatziki that it was served over. Rice accompanied
      the kebabs. Honestly I would have been fine without this entire course, but
      that&#39;s only because..<br><br>HAD to save room for dessert! Wow - this course
      stole the show. The waitstaff brought out a candle for my father&#39;s birthday
      and - just wait - EIGHT desserts for six people. We were blown away. We got
      two of each dessert - wow! My dad could not stop raving about the olive oil
      cake while my mom and sister in law enjoyed the decadent malabi custard. My
      personal favorite was the sorbet over the coconut rice pudding, YUM! The least
      favorite of the group seemed to be the chocolate tehina mousse. <br><br>The
      dinner ended up taking about 3 hours, and we enjoyed every minute. Can not wait

      hearts...never had these before but they were fatty and delicious! <br><br>For
      main dishes, we had the branzino which was perfectly crisped, and the fish itself
      was moist and flaky. The hanger steak is also a good choice, and actually tastes
      really good with the hummus if you have some left over.<br><br>For dessert,
      the malabi custard is a must. One of the best desserts I&#39;ve had. The rose
      glaze and hazelnut crumble complemented the custard so well.<br><br>Service

      in and had to try it out. Went to make a reservation and realized it was going
      to be a little while before it happened. They book three months in advanced-
      and I made one for 830pm @ midnight three months in advance for four people.
      There ended up only being three of us that went and they accommodated that nicely.
      <br><br>The restaurant- dim lit and super cute. There&#39;s a nice vibe in there<br><br>The
      service- I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had better service at a restaurant.
      They work like a well oiled machine. Our waters were never empty, if we finished
      a drink there was someone there asking if we needed another on our last sip.
      They explained the menu and what the daily hummus was. The service was excellent.
      <br><br>The food- all three of us did the 48 dollar tasting menu which I would
      recommend everyone does. It&#39;s so much food. We each got a hummus for the
      table, six daily vegetables, two apps per person, a main course per person and
      they brought out three desserts. They explained everything as they brought it
      to the table. My favorite was the hanger steak- it was like butter. All of the
      small plates we got were excellent. I really enjoyed the halumi cheese. But
      the most exciting thing was the hummus. It was the best hummus I ever had in
      my life, and presented so pretty<br><br>Dessert- I am usually not a huge dessert
      person, but when in Rome. And I will say I would yo here JUST for the dessert.
      I&#39;m not sure what it was, but there was a lemon cake with fruit and cream
      and a cream based dessert that were out of this world. Also a crunchy thing
      with warm chocolate. It was amazing<br><br>The whole experience was about two
      hours and very enjoyable. I will 100% be back and have already thought about
      making a reservation so I have something to look forward to.

    :comment: Six Salatim
    :body: After living in Philly for 4 years and considering myself a self-proclaimed
      &#34;foodie&#34;, this dining experience was long anticipated. My sister in
      law made a reservation 2 months in advance, waiting up until midnight to snag
      an 8pm reservation last night for my father&#39;s birthday. Zahav was so kind
      to print a personalized happy birthday message on the menu, which my father
      thought was cool and kept a menu for himself.<br><br>We had a party of 6 and
      opted for the tasting menu. The waitstaff was very attentive, thorough, and
      explained the dishes as they were coming out. For the table, we got two orders
      of the salatim (six vegetable salads) and to my surprise, the cabbage was my
      favorite! I could eat bowls of it!<br><br>Next we got to choose two hummus dishes,
      in which we chose the Turkish (served warm) - this tasted like mashed potatoes
      - consistency and all. But I enjoyed it nonetheless. The other hummus we chose
      was the tehina, which was tasty, but it was more of a &#34;typical&#34; hummus
      has there was no special twist or flavoring. The laffa was fresh, hot, and aplenty.
      They brought us out a third laffa upon request.<br><br>Ah, then the mezze course.
      Each of us got to choose two, so we ended up with 12 mezze. Now these plates
      are small but 12 was a LOT. My favorites were the amba pickled egg and the kibbe
      naya. My family really seemed to like the grilled haloumi. I even tried a duck
      heart, which was new for me!<br><br>By this point we were FULL but had two courses
      left! Each of us chose an entree, but we doubled up on the hanger steak and
      opted out of the mushroom. Each kebab was just big enough for each of us to
      have about 2-3 bites. The bronzino was cooked perfectly and very flavorful -
      my favorite part was the fresh tzatziki that it was served over. Rice accompanied
      the kebabs. Honestly I would have been fine without this entire course, but
      that&#39;s only because..<br><br>HAD to save room for dessert! Wow - this course
      stole the show. The waitstaff brought out a candle for my father&#39;s birthday
      and - just wait - EIGHT desserts for six people. We were blown away. We got
      two of each dessert - wow! My dad could not stop raving about the olive oil
      cake while my mom and sister in law enjoyed the decadent malabi custard. My
      personal favorite was the sorbet over the coconut rice pudding, YUM! The least
      favorite of the group seemed to be the chocolate tehina mousse. <br><br>The
      dinner ended up taking about 3 hours, and we enjoyed every minute. Can not wait
      for my next opportunity to return to Zahav!

      thing on the plate is incredible. The watermelon was the perfect watermelon,
      the cut blueberries that arrived with my dessert were what other blueberries
      aspire to be, and the peas that decorated my haloumi cheese were the best peas
      I&#39;ve ever had. <br><br> The service is so accommodating! My menu was the

      not bother to stop eating to take pictures of the entrees when they arrived.
      <br><br>We got sent over a sample of the duck hearts compliments of the chef,
      which I thought was such a nice touch. That&#39;s something I&#39;ll for sure
      remember about my delightful experience there. <br><br>Note that the bar is
      fairly crowded so you&#39;ll be real cozy with your neighbors!

    :body: A long awaited review! I heard about Zahav from a travel group I&#39;m

      to be a little while before it happened. They book three months in advanced-

      they brought out three desserts. They explained everything as they brought it
      to the table. My favorite was the hanger steak- it was like butter. All of the

  - :body: Philly, do you know how good you&#39;ve got it? I talk about how the restaurants
      in my current town are good, and how we have plenty of great meals for visitors
      to enjoy. Then I visit Philadelphia and happen upon a meal at a place like Barbuzzo,
      and I&#39;m reminded of what I left behind in the City of Brotherly love.<br><br>Service
      was excellent. No reservations were available online until super late, but we
      stopped by early and they were able to seat us right away. (Can&#39;t find your
      reservation time online? Give them a call.)<br><br>Cocktails were well-made.
      My husband liked their take on a negroni. We enjoyed a gem lettuce salad that
      was a delight, along with some flavorful grilled mushrooms and arancini. Pasta
      was excellent. <br><br>I appreciate their use of local ingredients where possible.
      Our food was so delicious that even though we probably over-ordered, we ate
      every last bite. Then we ordered the tiramisu for dessert anyway.<br><br>On
      my next Philly adventure, this definitely rates a second visit.

  - :body: 'I stopped by Barbuzzo with a group of 5 on a Wednesday night. I would
      recommend reservations, as most tables were full and there was a wait when we
      arrived. Barbuzzo has a nice atmosphere with dim lighting. Great setting for
      a date night. <br><br>The menu provides options for most common dietary restrictions
      (gluten free, vegetarian, etc.). Many of the options are small plates, meant
      to be shared. I ordered the sheeps&#39; milk ricotta for an appetizer, milled
      spelt casarecce (pasta) for main course, and tiramisu for dessert. <br><br>Ricotta:
      The ricotta had a fluffy texture and fresh flavor. The bread that came along
      with the appetizer was deliciously crispy. Once we ran out of bread, we started
      eating them leftover ricotta with our forks -- it was that good!<br><br>Pasta:
      The home made pasta had a great consistency and flavor, but the dish was incredibly
      rich. I found myself wanting to stop eating it after just a few bites. Since
      this was so heavy, next time, I would choose to try another dish, or split this
      dish with multiple people. <br><br>Tiramisu: Fun take on a traditional dessert.
      The cacao bibs were a nice crunchy addition, and the marscapone had a bold flavor.
      Portion size was very generous and could be shared between 2+ people. <br><br>Service
      was attentive and knowledgeable. Next time in the area, I will come back to
      Barbuzzo.'

  - :body: 'Beiler&#39;s doughnuts are what I grew up on, and for that reason alone
      I&#39;ll always love them. But there are a million other reasons why fellow
      Philadelphians and countless tourists who pass through Reading Terminal love
      Beiler&#39;s as well. Here&#39;s a few: they&#39;re always freshly made, consistently
      airy in texture, sweet in a way that invokes feelings of childlike happiness,
      and varied in flavors. <br><br>I don&#39;t stop by very often because I&#39;m
      not a fan of lines - especially in Reading, whose narrow corridors and sizeable
      crowds are claustrophobia-inducing. Today I walked into the entrance right by
      Beiler&#39;s a few minutes before noon. I wasn&#39;t planning on doughnuts,
      but there was no line! I&#39;ve never seen that before, and it really was just
      perfect timing, because the moment I hopped in line, around ten people slid
      in behind me. I ended up with the peanut butter, the blueberry and apple fritters,
      and a chocolate glazed (which were all very, very well-received. If you want
      to win friends and influence people, bring back some Beiler&#39;s).<br><br>The
      fritters are forever my favorites - especially the blueberry ones. They&#39;re
      not too sweet, the fruit lends a bit of juiciness to each bite, and the lightly
      fried exterior just has a slight crispness that contrasts nicely with the tender,
      soft interior. Everything else I&#39;ve had tends to be more on the sweeter
      side - I&#39;m talking candy levels of sweetness - but honestly, I still loved
      them all.<br><br>As an Amish-operated business, Beiler&#39;s isn&#39;t open
      on Sundays, so plan accordingly. They&#39;re worth the visit - and dare I say,
      even worth the often very, very long lines. Truly a special spot in Philly,
      and one of the best doughnuts you&#39;ll find on the East Coast.'

      little shop did worth the three hours ride alongside a bus seat which accelerated
      my back 30 years older; I&#39;m 27 years old, for goodness&#39;s sake. O the
      pain. <br><br>One bite of apple fritter had me forgetting all the pains and
      discomforts. It&#39;s amazing fresh, and soft! The sweetness is not as overpowering
      as one that the Dunkin&#39; Donut would have dunked into a vat of refined sugar
      a thousands of times. <br><br>Their cookie creme donut, on the other hand, was
      their &#34;cream of the crop,&#34; as a saying went. The filling was wonderfully
      creamy and light. Foodies with dense beard or &#39;staches, arm yourselves with
      a load of napkins for this one!<br><br>The price for each, after taking in the
      consideration of their quality, was so generous, you&#39;d think it&#39;s a
      steal.

      there is a short line for doughnuts at the bakery.  Don&#39;t despair!  The
      line moves quickly and, if you&#39;re lucky, you can see them makibg doughnuts
      so you truly understand what you are eating (and how unhealthy they truly are).
       We were able to see them dress some of the doughnuts with their delicious sugary
      icing.  I feel like we got a sugar rush just standing in line.  I asked what
      their popular choices werw and they saif anything from the top row, but especially
      the fritters.  We selected a single apple fritter.  It melted in your mouth.
       It was delicious and certainly worth our short wait.  It is worth a longer
      wait as well.<br><br>Now why the short one star?  This place is a travelers&#39;
      haven and the employees are efficient.  They aren&#39;t rude or mean either.
       The one star is for that extra the employees could havr provided to all of
      us travelers who chose to wait on line for a fritter.

      cream, peanut butter filled, glazed, and a Exotic Nutella filled caught my eye.
      All of the flavors were good, but the winner was the Boston Cream. Heavy weight
      wise with a nice crisp, flaky bite and a nice vanilla flavored custard. <br>The
      other choices were all crisp and flaky as well, the chocolate on top of them
      was delicious and fresh. The Nutella filled was a decent donut, you can definitely

  - :body: So good!!! <br><br>I have been here quite a few times. The berrylicious
      French toast is my favorite. Very cute inside makes you feel like you are on
      vacation. Food is delicious and flavorful. They care for each dish and have
      very unique ingredients and combinations. <br><br>The last time I went it was
      pouring outside and the owner ran out and gave us an umbrella. <br><br>Really
      a great welcoming delicious place!

      delicious. Even more challenging, all of the photos of the dishes on Yelp look
      fantastic too. <br><br>I ended up going with my gut and ordered the Green Shakshuka.

      5 stars is my weird interaction on the phone when I called ahead on Saturday.
      I asked how long the wait would be so I knew if it was worth bringing my dad/step

      know how long the wait is. <br><br>Alright...So I asked her if she could check

      not a host.&#34; I then asked if she could ask a fellow host to which she said
      &#34;no again because I&#39;m a bartender.&#34; She also refused to just look
      around the restaurant with her eyes and tell me if it was busy...<br><br>Very
      weird, terrible customer service experience. That person should definitely get

  - :body: One of the prettiest, fairytale-like venues I&#39;ve ever dined at! The
      outdoor seating is lovely, and it makes you feel like you are eating inside
      a secret garden! Very clean, staff is very poised and professional. I&#39;m
      not from Philly and was here just for a day-cation. I usually do not like to
      repeat restaurants since I try to venture out to as many different places as
      I can, but this is one of the few places I would repeat again when I go back
      to Philly! Next time, I&#39;d love to try an indoor seating because honestly,
      the whole place is just so esthetically pleasing. <br><br>As for the food, I
      got the steak and eggs, and my boyfriend got the roasted duck. Both of our dishes
      were pretty good, but the meats were cold- so odd. The sauce, veggies, and potatoes
      were very flavorful, but we were disappointed that our food was not hot on the
      plate. <br><br>If you encounter this problem, I would just inform the waiter/waitress
      to re-cook it. For the price you are paying, you should not have this issue,
      and if you do, you have the right to ask :).

      could not have picked a better spot! The fairy garden vibes were originally
      what attracted us, and as we ventured inside it just got better. Lots of cozy
      tables with nice lighting and a perfect atmosphere to enjoy ourselves and chat.
      The drinks, while a bit pricey, were delicious and a great way to start our
      meal. When the server noticed it was my friend&#39;s birthday on his ID, she
      brought us over a mini cheese sampling to try for free. So sweet!<br><br>The
      food was TO DIE FOR. We started with a cheese plate (a must have) and then each
      moved on to an entree - each plate was so well thought out and so tasty. We
      ordered desserts, as well, which was probably a little too much food, but it
      was a birthday! The server made sure my friend&#39;s dessert was brought out
      with a candle. Everything was delicious.<br><br>Talula&#39;s Garden is the perfect
      mix of friendly, thoughtful, and delicious. An excellent place to celebrate.

  :reviews:
  - :body: I have been to morimoto twice, and I absolutely love the food here. My
      favorite dishes in order are the Chilean sea bass (for anyone who has had a
      poor experience with badly cooked Chilean sea bass at other restaurants, PLEASE
      give it another shot here). It is SO tender and buttery, and it absorbs all
      the flavor from the delicious lemon and buttery sauce. Next I think it is worth
      to get 2oz to 4oz of A5 wagyu. It is so tender and fatty, but 2oz was definitely
      enough for me (by the end I couldn&#39;t handle more richness). <br><br>I also
      loved the white fish carpaccio and toro tartare. The toro tartare is a small
      portion so if you are capitalizing on amount of food, maybe not an order, but
      I will definitely order it the next time I come! I think the crab cakes are
      a pass, but only because everything else is so amazing in comparison.<br><br>The
      desserts also are not as stellar, but I think the main highlights are the fish
      dishes (sashimi and sushi here are amazing).  Anyways, definitely a great meal
      (worth the splurge). It&#39;s not too crowded (even on Friday night) so you
      don&#39;t need to worry about making a reservation more than a day or two in
      advance. <br><br>Just a note on the ambiance - feels like a modern, upscale
      restaurant much more than the traditional, French fine dining vibe. Definitely
      liked it though (pairs well with the idea of chic Japanese cuisine).

  - :body: This is a difficult review to write, as Marimoto is not at all just an
      average restaurant.  The food was very good, the service was above and beyond
      phenomenal, the ambience was upbeat and fun, and the cocktails were unique and
      delicious. However, we came for the omakase, and the experience was not up to
      par for a restaurant of this caliber and, especially, the price.<br><br>We sat
      at the sushi bar because we like to watch the sushi chefs at work. The lighting
      and vibe of the restaurant is trendy, classy, and definitely adds to the dining
      experience. Our waitress was fun and attentive. We ordered cocktails off the
      menu, both spicy as recommended, and they were delicious. When we needed something
      else to drink, I believe it was the manager described a saki to us, where it
      was from, and why she recommended it. She was definitely very knowledgable on
      what they served.<br><br>Outstanding omakase that I&#39;ve had in the past was
      an intimate and unique experience where the sushi chef decided what he/she thought
      would be best for you. This was very preplanned and very average. Dishes that
      stood out were the miso black cod - melt in your mouth tender and flavor that
      was almost indescribable, and the tuna tartar where I was hoping every bite
      would not be my last. I was most disappointed in the wagyu beef - from Australia,
      had a kind of odd toasted corn flavor to it, and was pretty tough, not at all
      the tenderness that top quality beef should have. The sushi part of the omakase
      was also very average - a standard assortment of tuna, salmon, and other regulars
      bringing nothing unique and memorable to the table. Dessert was an fruit flavored
      algar jelly dish that I, personally, would not say is the best they had to offer
      on the menu.<br><br>I enjoyed eating at Marimoto. The servers were so wonderful
      and made the night even more enjoyable. My biggest issue was paying a $400+
      (including tip) bill for a meal that I did not consider an outstanding nor something
      I would write home about. I would come to Marimoto for a happy hour or small
      bites, but I am pretty disappointed with the omakase experience here.

  - :body: 'With a really, REALLY regretful heart I think I am actually, honestly
      about to give Morimoto four stars (although, I would do a 4 1/2 if Yelp let
      me).<br><br>Let&#39;s start with a few qualifiers: 1) I definitely did hype
      up Morimoto before coming here, and maybe I should&#39;ve just come with a more
      open mind.  2) I think I put too much emphasis on the sushi options here, and
      Morimoto isn&#39;t necessary an exclusive sushi heavy restaurant - they do a
      modern Japanese cuisine that encompasses more than just sushi.  For that reason,
      maybe stacking up my expectations against incredible sushi omakases I&#39;ve
      been to isn&#39;t fair (i.e. Royal Sushi in Queen&#39;s Village).<br><br>I took
      my partner to Morimoto for his birthday, and weird side note I&#39;m always
      really pleased when a restaurant at least gives you a little candle in your
      dessert for whoever&#39;s bday you&#39;re celebrating. Thanks for that Morimoto!<br><br>We
      did the omakase for each of us, which is a sampler of everything the restaurant
      has to offer: a mixture of raw dishes, sushi, and also cooked foods.<br><br>I
      wish I could remember it all, but my favorites were definitely the wagyu cutlets
      and the beef tartar.  Wagyu will be wagyu - always incredible, so I&#39;m not
      sure how much of that was up to the restaurant&#39;s preparation. The beef tartar
      starter though was really delicious.  I just felt like the sushi they served
      us were not as amazing as sushi I&#39;ve had elsewhere, especially in terms
      of flavor combinations and fish selection, and again I think for Morimoto&#39;s
      reputation I sort of expected more from the sushi.  Regardless though, I did
      overall like the marinated skate and the salad dish with the sashimi pieces.
      <br><br>I do want to say though, the dessert - wow.  I would go back for their
      happy hour and just order that dessert.  It was a strawberry, milky gelatin
      pudding type thing and I loved every. single. bite!  Their sake selection also
      can&#39;t be beat and I am actually trying to go back and just try more sakes.
       <br><br>The ambiance is beautiful and the service is the best service I have
      ever experienced at a restaurant hands down.  We had a weird thing happen where
      it was raining heavily outside and the rain leaked inside over just our table
      - we were moved immediately and they comped our sake bottle for the very small
      inconvenience. Our waiter was so helpful and knowledgeable about the sakes they
      offered, and so we&#39;re really grateful to be honest for how hard everyone
      worked to make the night lovely. <br><br>All in all we did enjoy ourselves but
      I guess the biggest downside is that the hype may be too inflated for the experience
      itself.  Overall though please do go - it&#39;s a gorgeous restaurant with a
      solid menu.  Just maybe order a la carte.'

      times were very limited. So on this go round, I made an early reservation to
      ensure that we got in.<br><br>From the outside, the restaurant is fairly understated
      but walking in, I was transported to a very uniquely designed dining room that
      was the perfect backdrop for a dining experience. The furniture was very clean

      perused the menu and while the duck, duck, duck was calling my name and my friend
      was debating about ordering the miso cod, we both knew that we were gonna go
      with the omakase. For $125 for 8 courses, it&#39;s a time and financial commitment
      but we were excited about what was to come.<br><br>I love it when I get to try
      something I&#39;ve never had before or when common foods are imagined in different
      ways. Throughout the course of this meal, I found myself thinking that not only
      was it delicious but several of the courses were very creative. I mean I&#39;ve
      had miso black cod a number of times. Each time, the fish just melts in my mouth.
      This time was no exception but the sweet honey mustard sauce was a perfect complement
      to the dish. And then, that broth that the toro tartare was sitting in...so
      rich yet light and a bite of the fatty fish along with the wasabi was amazing.
      And to finish, we had a sweet milk panna cotta with sake gelee and rhubarb...whhaattt!
      Incredible, just incredible.<br><br>Other dishes included a white fish carpaccio
      with Japanese snapper, amberjack fish and tuna salad, <br>Japanese citrus with
      pear and mint, sashimi, and their 72h wagyu. The only dish I wasn&#39;t crazy
      about was the cooked amberjack which I found difficult to cut and texturally

  - :body: 'Last night, after our trip to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, we had dinner
      at Morimoto Philadelphia. To start, I had the Yellowtail Tartare ($22) -- caviar
      and fresh wasabi, and the Rock Shrimp Tempura ($21) -- spicy &#39;kochujan&#39;
      aïoli and endive. We then shared a seasonal platter of fresh sashimi ($60),
      which included cuts of toro, salmon and barracuda, among other things. For my
      entree, I ordered the Duck Duck Duck ($35) -- roasted duck breast, duck confit
      fried rice, duck egg, mandarin oolong reduction.  For dessert, we shared the
      Fiery Chocolate Tart ($20) -- brownie, burnt miso ice cream, toasted meringue,
      sesame. <br><br>This is too much to go over in detail, so let&#39;s just start
      with some of the positives: The toro sashimi was some of the best I&#39;ve ever
      had. The pure melt-in-your-mouth effect was something that I was pleasantly
      surprised with -- not to mentioned that the platter as a whole looked absolutely
      beautiful. The roasted duck breast was cooked to perfection, with crispy skin
      on the outside and moist meat on the inside. What I really enjoyed about the
      dessert, aside from the beautiful theatrics that came with the dish, was how
      thoughtful and well-balanced it was. The brownies had a pleasant amount of sweetness
      to them, largely due to the generous amount of salt that was added. Had they
      not added as much salt, the dish would&#39;ve been thrown off balance by the
      rich sweetness of the brownie. <br><br>Now for some of the negatives: Although
      we enjoyed the rock shrimp tempura, we felt that they could have been much more
      liberal on the seasoning. Although we understood the sweet-spicy combination
      they were trying to achieve, we feel that the combination should have been used
      more aggressively. And although I loved the duck fried rice, I found it to be
      slightly greasy. <br><br>Even when splitting hairs, as I did above in my criticisms,
      it was still clear to us that Morimoto Philadelphia excels in their creative
      flavor profiles, over-the-top presentation, and enjoyable service. Therefore,
      they earn 5 stars.'

      about the dishes he seemed only half interested in engaging. He just didn&#39;t
      seem that interested in serving us which is not what I would expect from such
      a restaurant. <br><br>In a nutshell, the best sushi and sashimi I&#34;ve had
      in town and the fish entrees are to die for. However the overall experience
      wasn&#39;t quite as nice as I was hoping.

  - :body: Morimoto has been a place on my bucket list for years. It lived up to its
      expectations - it was beyond belief! We got the omakase dinner with the sake
      omakase pairing, which is the chef&#39;s tasting 8 course food and drink menu.
      Although very pricy, it is WELL worth it if you are celebrating a fun event!
      The omakase entrees were well-paired and delicious. The best, by far, was the
      poached/grilled lobster tail. It was buttery, rich, and cooked to perfection.
      The panna cotta was a great finish at the end. In regards to the sake omakase,
      I would only recommend this if you have a high tolerance!! It comes with 8 full-sized
      sakes (1 paired carefully with each entree). We could only finish 3/8! Would
      probably not do the sake omakase again. But, would DEFINITELY do the omakase
      again. The service, food, and ambience were amazing. Will definitely be coming
      back to Morimoto soon!

      dimensional architecture invoke calm and an ocean wave form of tranquility.
       <br><br>But the food !!   Sushi and Sashimi was amazing.  But there were these
      little treats like the wagu dumplings and the surprise was the amazing duck.
       And I rarely have duck.  <br><br>The lighting creates these great selfies and
      photos too!   So just go !

    :body: I have been to morimoto twice, and I absolutely love the food here. My
      favorite dishes in order are the Chilean sea bass (for anyone who has had a
      poor experience with badly cooked Chilean sea bass at other restaurants, PLEASE
      give it another shot here). It is SO tender and buttery, and it absorbs all
      the flavor from the delicious lemon and buttery sauce. Next I think it is worth
      to get 2oz to 4oz of A5 wagyu. It is so tender and fatty, but 2oz was definitely
      enough for me (by the end I couldn&#39;t handle more richness). <br><br>I also
      loved the white fish carpaccio and toro tartare. The toro tartare is a small
      portion so if you are capitalizing on amount of food, maybe not an order, but
      I will definitely order it the next time I come! I think the crab cakes are
      a pass, but only because everything else is so amazing in comparison.<br><br>The
      desserts also are not as stellar, but I think the main highlights are the fish
      dishes (sashimi and sushi here are amazing).  Anyways, definitely a great meal
      (worth the splurge). It&#39;s not too crowded (even on Friday night) so you
      don&#39;t need to worry about making a reservation more than a day or two in
      advance. <br><br>Just a note on the ambiance - feels like a modern, upscale
      restaurant much more than the traditional, French fine dining vibe. Definitely
      liked it though (pairs well with the idea of chic Japanese cuisine).

      phenomenal, the ambience was upbeat and fun, and the cocktails were unique and

      menu, both spicy as recommended, and they were delicious. When we needed something

      stood out were the miso black cod - melt in your mouth tender and flavor that
      was almost indescribable, and the tuna tartar where I was hoping every bite
      would not be my last. I was most disappointed in the wagyu beef - from Australia,
      had a kind of odd toasted corn flavor to it, and was pretty tough, not at all
      the tenderness that top quality beef should have. The sushi part of the omakase
      was also very average - a standard assortment of tuna, salmon, and other regulars

    :body: Amazing food. Very knowledgeable and attentive servers! We didnt do the
      catering menu but went with the salmon with was spicy with a ton of flavor.
      The pork belly, which was incredible and a must have. Wagyu dumplings that were
      also so flavorful and the skirt steak which was perfect to share with two people.
      Love the decor in here also

    :comment: Sweet milk panna cotta, sake gelee, and rhubarb
    :body: I tried to visit Morimoto on a recent visit to Philly but the dinner dining
      times were very limited. So on this go round, I made an early reservation to
      ensure that we got in.<br><br>From the outside, the restaurant is fairly understated
      but walking in, I was transported to a very uniquely designed dining room that
      was the perfect backdrop for a dining experience. The furniture was very clean
      and white and dim lights with uplighting added a little ambiance. <br><br>We
      perused the menu and while the duck, duck, duck was calling my name and my friend
      was debating about ordering the miso cod, we both knew that we were gonna go
      with the omakase. For $125 for 8 courses, it&#39;s a time and financial commitment
      but we were excited about what was to come.<br><br>I love it when I get to try
      something I&#39;ve never had before or when common foods are imagined in different
      ways. Throughout the course of this meal, I found myself thinking that not only
      was it delicious but several of the courses were very creative. I mean I&#39;ve
      had miso black cod a number of times. Each time, the fish just melts in my mouth.
      This time was no exception but the sweet honey mustard sauce was a perfect complement
      to the dish. And then, that broth that the toro tartare was sitting in...so
      rich yet light and a bite of the fatty fish along with the wasabi was amazing.
      And to finish, we had a sweet milk panna cotta with sake gelee and rhubarb...whhaattt!
      Incredible, just incredible.<br><br>Other dishes included a white fish carpaccio
      with Japanese snapper, amberjack fish and tuna salad, <br>Japanese citrus with
      pear and mint, sashimi, and their 72h wagyu. The only dish I wasn&#39;t crazy
      about was the cooked amberjack which I found difficult to cut and texturally
      unappealing.<br><br>This was my first omakase experience and Morimoto&#39;s
      was a great place for it.

    :comment: Sashimi Platter
    :body: 'Last night, after our trip to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, we had dinner
      at Morimoto Philadelphia. To start, I had the Yellowtail Tartare ($22) -- caviar
      and fresh wasabi, and the Rock Shrimp Tempura ($21) -- spicy &#39;kochujan&#39;
      aïoli and endive. We then shared a seasonal platter of fresh sashimi ($60),
      which included cuts of toro, salmon and barracuda, among other things. For my
      entree, I ordered the Duck Duck Duck ($35) -- roasted duck breast, duck confit
      fried rice, duck egg, mandarin oolong reduction.  For dessert, we shared the
      Fiery Chocolate Tart ($20) -- brownie, burnt miso ice cream, toasted meringue,
      sesame. <br><br>This is too much to go over in detail, so let&#39;s just start
      with some of the positives: The toro sashimi was some of the best I&#39;ve ever
      had. The pure melt-in-your-mouth effect was something that I was pleasantly
      surprised with -- not to mentioned that the platter as a whole looked absolutely
      beautiful. The roasted duck breast was cooked to perfection, with crispy skin
      on the outside and moist meat on the inside. What I really enjoyed about the
      dessert, aside from the beautiful theatrics that came with the dish, was how
      thoughtful and well-balanced it was. The brownies had a pleasant amount of sweetness
      to them, largely due to the generous amount of salt that was added. Had they
      not added as much salt, the dish would&#39;ve been thrown off balance by the
      rich sweetness of the brownie. <br><br>Now for some of the negatives: Although
      we enjoyed the rock shrimp tempura, we felt that they could have been much more
      liberal on the seasoning. Although we understood the sweet-spicy combination
      they were trying to achieve, we feel that the combination should have been used
      more aggressively. And although I loved the duck fried rice, I found it to be
      slightly greasy. <br><br>Even when splitting hairs, as I did above in my criticisms,
      it was still clear to us that Morimoto Philadelphia excels in their creative
      flavor profiles, over-the-top presentation, and enjoyable service. Therefore,
      they earn 5 stars.'

    :comment: 'Omakase #8: panna cotta'
    :body: Morimoto has been a place on my bucket list for years. It lived up to its
      expectations - it was beyond belief! We got the omakase dinner with the sake
      omakase pairing, which is the chef&#39;s tasting 8 course food and drink menu.
      Although very pricy, it is WELL worth it if you are celebrating a fun event!
      The omakase entrees were well-paired and delicious. The best, by far, was the
      poached/grilled lobster tail. It was buttery, rich, and cooked to perfection.
      The panna cotta was a great finish at the end. In regards to the sake omakase,
      I would only recommend this if you have a high tolerance!! It comes with 8 full-sized
      sakes (1 paired carefully with each entree). We could only finish 3/8! Would

    :body: Morimoto has been a place on my bucket list for years. It lived up to its
      expectations - it was beyond belief! We got the omakase dinner with the sake
      omakase pairing, which is the chef&#39;s tasting 8 course food and drink menu.
      Although very pricy, it is WELL worth it if you are celebrating a fun event!
      The omakase entrees were well-paired and delicious. The best, by far, was the
      poached/grilled lobster tail. It was buttery, rich, and cooked to perfection.
      The panna cotta was a great finish at the end. In regards to the sake omakase,
      I would only recommend this if you have a high tolerance!! It comes with 8 full-sized
      sakes (1 paired carefully with each entree). We could only finish 3/8! Would
      probably not do the sake omakase again. But, would DEFINITELY do the omakase

      and Chips was a major disappointment given the type of establishment this is.
       First look, it seemed great, the portion size was good and the food on the
      plate was piping hot.  However after shifting the fish over to the left of where
      it was plated, major oil spill was detected, as you can see from the picture.
       Clearly this fish was not finished properly by draining the oil prior to plating.
       As a result the underside of this filet was soggy and no tartar, lemon, or
      ketchup was going to be able to save this oily mess.  Excluding the exterior,
      the fish filet was not seasoned leaving me to wonder if I was at the right place
      for fish and chips.<br><br>The fries were horrible.  These were some of the
      worse I&#39;ve had in a long time.  They were packed in so tightly in the metal
      cup right after frying, that half of each fry steamed up and lost their exterior
      crunch.  Surprisingly there was also no seasoning to speak of on the fries.

      unimpressed by the brunch menu. I ordered their famous bread pudding with vanilla
      ice cream on top, and I hate to disagree with all the rave reviews about it.
      It was saturated with syrup and was almost &#34;cloyingly&#34; sweet. Why can&#39;t
      restaurants start serving the syrup on the side? Not everyone has the same taste
      palate. <br><br>Anyway, I also tried the rose mimosa and it was alright, I would
      go a few blocks further to Indeblue to get their rose mimosas instead.

      over salted.  Huge chunks of Brioche Toast and the Grape Chutney helped to offset
      the sodium overload but ultimately didn&#39;t do enough.  Incredibly there was
      finishing salt on top of the Chicken and Duck Liver as if it needed it.  I left
      behind much of this dish as a result.<br><br>The main entree Beer Battered Fish
      and Chips was a major disappointment given the type of establishment this is.
       First look, it seemed great, the portion size was good and the food on the
      plate was piping hot.  However after shifting the fish over to the left of where
      it was plated, major oil spill was detected, as you can see from the picture.
       Clearly this fish was not finished properly by draining the oil prior to plating.
       As a result the underside of this filet was soggy and no tartar, lemon, or
      ketchup was going to be able to save this oily mess.  Excluding the exterior,
      the fish filet was not seasoned leaving me to wonder if I was at the right place
      for fish and chips.<br><br>The fries were horrible.  These were some of the
      worse I&#39;ve had in a long time.  They were packed in so tightly in the metal
      cup right after frying, that half of each fry steamed up and lost their exterior
      crunch.  Surprisingly there was also no seasoning to speak of on the fries.
       <br><br>The service was quick and efficient.

      are trendy restaurants who charge a lot of money and then have you leave hungry.<br><br>Vedge
      is the opposite. I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night, and the experience
      didn&#39;t disappoint. As someone who should eat more vegetables (don&#39;t
      we all) and with a friend who can&#39;t do dairy, Vedge had an appeal as something
      different but could work for both of us. The meal was tops. Nothing was disappointing.<br><br>This
      place is a bit pricey... usually I&#39;d give good food + $ four stars. But
      TBH, the service was quite good, so I&#39;ll give this an extra bump. Back in
      DC, we&#39;re so used to mediocre service, that *good* service is memorable.
      I&#39;d happily stop in again on another trip through Philly.

  - :body: Amazing simply amazing!!!   This was the best vegetarian meal I ever had.
       The restaurant is housed in an old mansion in the middle of Locust Street.
       The decor is pretty slick and inviting. <br><br>Collin was our waiter and he
      is simply the best.  His food recommendations were top notch!  He gave us a
      cool tip about the menu everything from the rutabaga fondue on down was warm
      food.  Nice tip, huh!? <br><br>Collin encouraged us to share portions at our
      table so I was able to nibble on some other foods during our dining experience.
       I suggest you do the same.  <br><br>Well to start off I had rutabaga fondue.
       A soft warm pretzel dipped in this &#34;cheesy&#34; fondue.  I mean you would
      swear it was cheese but of course it wasn&#39;t.  We enjoyed every bite and
      just as fast as the pretzel was consumed we received another portion of pretzel.
       Simply delicious!!!<br><br>Next I went with the spring peas and beans.  The
      mashed potatoes were smoked and gave off a bacon kind of vibe.  My mouth was
      watering for more.<br><br>Last for my dinner was the maitake mushroom.   This
      was the absolute best mushroom meal I had in a very long time.  I should have
      ordered a second plate of this , what I can only describe as &#34;ultimate pleasure
      on a plate&#34;. <br><br>For dessert I had the black and blue.  Its a chocolate
      experience unlike no other.  The flavors danced in my mouth.  I mean dance like
      the Wop or the Cabbage Patch.  (Not dance like the Whoa.  That&#39;s not a dance
      it&#39;s an embarrassment.) <br><br>My suggestion is to get one of each of the
      meals.  But this is a good place to share plates with each other.  I would also
      see if you can get Collin as your waiter.  He is the ultimate.  Oh yeah the
      other tip is to get the Fruit Adventure as your drink.  It tasted like a refreshing
      summer drink. <br><br>No matter what you choose here you wi not be disappointed
      by the Vedge experience!!

      interesting and unique. I liked the beet dish as well. We had seven dishes for
      three people and it was perfect.  Overall, the food was good and the service
      and setting are excellent. <br>I&#39;ve been to a lot of vegetarian/vegan restaurants

      and classy, yet rustic feel, with hefty wood workings adoring the walls, and
      a spacious opened kitchen.  Seating is comfortable and the atmosphere is perfect
      for a group or an intimate evening.  The servers are knowledgeable about the
      menu and have favorite dishes.  We never had to ask for drink refills, dishes
      were bused efficiently, and time between courses was appropriate.  <br><br>The
      dishes are priced very fairly and the servings are surprisingly generous.  They&#39;ll
      recommend you get one item from each section of the menu, which I agree with.
       You may find it to be a lot of food, but you&#39;re lucky enough to eat here,
      so try as much as you can!  <br><br>For a starter I had the fondu.  Delicious
      and convincing!  The bread is tasty and the pickles cut the fat beautifully.
       <br><br>Next I had the peas and beans, and my friend got the Brussels sprout
      salad.  Both were fantastic (but I did enjoy the peas and beans slightly more).
       <br><br>Entree we shared &#34;the carrot&#34; and the roasted mushrooms.  Again
      - loved them both, but the carrot was very unique. <br><br>For dessert we shared
      the strawberry shortcake and the wasabi cheesecake.  The cheesecake was shockingly
      realistic and the strawberry shortcake was nostalgic of the days of the good
      humor truck.  <br><br>Definitely worth it and would absolutely return!

      plates of veggies. Veggies deserve the respect and love they get at Vedge -

    :comment: Salt Roasted Golden Beet with Black Garlic Tahini and Farro
    :body: Our recent dinner at Vedge was absolutely incredible! We are not vegetarian
      by any stretch, but have been striving to eat a more &#34;plant forward&#34;
      diet and loved that we were able to enjoy a four course meal without consuming
      anything fried or overdoing it on the portions. I have long felt that creating
      delicious dishes with vegetables takes more skill than grilling a steak, and
      the folks at Vedge have nailed their veggie game. <br><br>The restaurant is
      in an old brownstone, which gives it a unique layout. It&#39;s beautifully decorated
      and we enjoyed our small, perfect-for-two booth in a room where a lot of the
      food prep was being done. Similar to others, our waiter suggested ordering one
      dish per section per person, which amounts to one cold appetizer, one warm appetizer,
      and one entree. <br><br>Drinkwise, I chose one of their seasonal cocktails called
      Something Like Summer. It featured bourbon, hibiscus, and fennel and was crisp,
      refreshing, and delicious. BF got a black cherry cocktail and was less enthused,
      though I thought it was good. <br><br>For our first course, we chose the mushroom
      carpaccio --- perfectly seasoned, thin slices of mushroom with &#34;deviled
      kohlrabi&#34; --- and the stuffed avocado. The avocado was one of the highlights
      of the meal and I can&#39;t recommend enough! It&#39;s got pickled cauliflower,
      &#34;fried rice,&#34; and an incredible romesco sauce that we scraped off of
      the plate without shame. <br><br>Next, we had the brussels sprouts and the summer
      squash. The shaved brussels sprouts had smoky, crispy mushrooms on top that
      were impressively similar to bacon and had a mustard-based sauce that was delicious.

    :body: Really delicious vegan and vegetarian options! All the dishes I had were
      so yummy and fun, different from most vegetarian options at restaurants. The
      two of us were able to get a spot at the bar during happy hour and had great
      service from the bartender. The stuffed avocado was our favorite dish but everything
      else had great flavor as well!

    :body: Amazing simply amazing!!!   This was the best vegetarian meal I ever had.
       The restaurant is housed in an old mansion in the middle of Locust Street.
       The decor is pretty slick and inviting. <br><br>Collin was our waiter and he
      is simply the best.  His food recommendations were top notch!  He gave us a
      cool tip about the menu everything from the rutabaga fondue on down was warm
      food.  Nice tip, huh!? <br><br>Collin encouraged us to share portions at our
      table so I was able to nibble on some other foods during our dining experience.
       I suggest you do the same.  <br><br>Well to start off I had rutabaga fondue.
       A soft warm pretzel dipped in this &#34;cheesy&#34; fondue.  I mean you would
      swear it was cheese but of course it wasn&#39;t.  We enjoyed every bite and
      just as fast as the pretzel was consumed we received another portion of pretzel.
       Simply delicious!!!<br><br>Next I went with the spring peas and beans.  The
      mashed potatoes were smoked and gave off a bacon kind of vibe.  My mouth was
      watering for more.<br><br>Last for my dinner was the maitake mushroom.   This
      was the absolute best mushroom meal I had in a very long time.  I should have
      ordered a second plate of this , what I can only describe as &#34;ultimate pleasure
      on a plate&#34;. <br><br>For dessert I had the black and blue.  Its a chocolate
      experience unlike no other.  The flavors danced in my mouth.  I mean dance like
      the Wop or the Cabbage Patch.  (Not dance like the Whoa.  That&#39;s not a dance
      it&#39;s an embarrassment.) <br><br>My suggestion is to get one of each of the
      meals.  But this is a good place to share plates with each other.  I would also
      see if you can get Collin as your waiter.  He is the ultimate.  Oh yeah the
      other tip is to get the Fruit Adventure as your drink.  It tasted like a refreshing
      summer drink. <br><br>No matter what you choose here you wi not be disappointed
      by the Vedge experience!!

      were bused efficiently, and time between courses was appropriate.  <br><br>The
      dishes are priced very fairly and the servings are surprisingly generous.  They&#39;ll
      recommend you get one item from each section of the menu, which I agree with.
       You may find it to be a lot of food, but you&#39;re lucky enough to eat here,
      so try as much as you can!  <br><br>For a starter I had the fondu.  Delicious
      and convincing!  The bread is tasty and the pickles cut the fat beautifully.
       <br><br>Next I had the peas and beans, and my friend got the Brussels sprout
      salad.  Both were fantastic (but I did enjoy the peas and beans slightly more).
       <br><br>Entree we shared &#34;the carrot&#34; and the roasted mushrooms.  Again
      - loved them both, but the carrot was very unique. <br><br>For dessert we shared
      the strawberry shortcake and the wasabi cheesecake.  The cheesecake was shockingly
      realistic and the strawberry shortcake was nostalgic of the days of the good
      humor truck.  <br><br>Definitely worth it and would absolutely return!

      on a humble forgotten vedge!) and shaved brussels (super savory and terrific
      textures) and the maitake dish (beautifully crisped up without a shy amount
      of butter!!)<br><br>Not convinced? Apparently there is a happy hour where you
      can get a little taste without bustin the bank. But honestly, turn off your
      notifications, put on some organic earrings and savor a fancy little date night
      celebrating the mundane.

    :body: My first vegan restaurant! I thought the food was very tasty but the portion
      sizes are very small. They suggest you order 3 different plates with each one
      being at least $15. I loved the taste of everything but just not the portion
      :(<br><br>They don&#39;t allow outside cakes (even if they are vegan cakes)
      but they were nice enough to hold our cake in the fridge because we didn&#39;t
      know. <br><br>All drinks were delightful! The cocktails my friends ordered were
      delicious and I ordered a light beer which was very refreshing. <br><br>The
      service was great and so was the ambiance. I would definitely recommend to a
      vegan friend!

       Price point was  reasonable for such a tasty meal.<br><br>Gino&#39;s isn&#39;t
      a traditional sit-down; it&#39;s a blend of a convenience store and short-cook.
       Two long bar-height and dining-height rows of tables in an area about the size
      of the front area of a 7-11.

      beef on the burger was mediocre, with no flavor and my steak on my philly was
      ok, it needed salt, and my bread was chewy. So they forgot to enter my order,
      and by the time I knew it, people ordering after me were getting their food.
      The guy preparing my food was apologetic, but I felt they rushed my order, so
      the food came out just okay. They offered me a drink prior to ordering since
      it was my first time, but by the time my food came out, my ice had already watered
      down my soda. <br>Staff was friendly, but not enough to make me want to return.

      had gas pumps. I don&#39;t remember a whole lot, just that it was before work,
      and the customer service was absolutely outstanding.<br><br>Last week I invited
      a couple of coworkers out to lunch and we decided on Gino&#39;s. It was delicious,
      and everyone was hustling to crank out sandwiches. Despite the routine and well-oiled
      machine of it all, though, they took excellent care of us an brightened when
      we asked for their recommendations.<br><br>My two buddies ordered the Philly
      Cheesesteak and I had a cold cut pastrami sandwich. They were not shy filling
      that bad boy up, and as someone who isn&#39;t a genuine fan of cold cut sandwiches,
      I have to say this was definitely my top sandwich ever.<br><br>I drive by this
      place almost daily and it&#39;s always packed during its open hours, but I totally
      get the hype. The food is great, and the service here can&#39;t be beat.

  :reviews:
  - :body: Thank you Garry and Bryan and the whole Esquire team!<br><br>There&#39;s
      a reason why this place has so many great reviews.  Add another one to the list-
      mine!  The staff is SUPER NICE and the service at Esquire Tavern is top notch.<br><br>As
      soon as you walk in the door, the history and charm of the bar instantly transcends
      you to another time. The low lighting in the evening, the crazy looooooong bar,
      the warm and friendly staff, the cooky taxidermy- all make for a unique experience.
      The upstairs is a great place for friends (and family!) to gather. Lively, yet
      with a cool atmosphere. <br><br>Downstairs is totally sexy.  Didn&#39;t know
      there was a downstairs? Yeah- this is a must. Great for a sexy date night (or
      any type of secret rendezvous, wink wink). A speakeasy vibe that feels more
      like a night in Paris. The cocktails are craft, with Reserve spirits for those
      wanting a supreme libation experience.<br><br>Me and my crew were there to celebrate
      a surprise birthday on a girls trip. The Esquire staff made the night so special.
      They were very accommodating and added special touches to make the night unique.
      We had cupcakes pre-delivered, and the Esquire team added beautiful sparkler
      candles to liven them up. We also added a delicious sparkling Rose which was
      AMAZING as a follow-up to our craft cocktails.<br><br>This place is a winner
      for a night out in downtown San Antonio.  Well played Esquire Tavern. Well played
      indeed.

      happy hour for food and drinks (not many places have happy hour past 6p). <br><br>Food
      is pretty solid - recommend shrimp toast, fish &amp; chips (big portion) and

      We both has ordered an old fashioned and they were made perfectly! We got the

      I was really in the mood for a burger, so I ordered the Esquire Cheeseburger.
      The cheese was melted to perfection. I had ordered the chili-salt fries as a
      side and it went so well with their ketchup. It was like a spicy bbq ketchup.

      a concert at the Aztec theater. It&#39;s only a few minutes walk and the drinks
      are miles better than at a concert venue! They opened right after prohibition
      ended and pre-date the riverwalk. The interior reflects this and feels lived-in,
      which I liked... it didn&#39;t feel touristy, despite it&#39;s location. My
      husband ordered a Weller Antique bourbon pour and it was only $8! They have
      a solid craft cocktail game and have a good selection of local beers on tap.
      The empanada was on the smaller side, but perfect for my appetite that day and
      brought a fair amount of spicy heat. My husband really enjoyed his bison burger.

    :body: I&#39;m an out of towner and was looking for a place with a good quality
      burger. After reading many reviews from different sites I came here . <br>It&#39;s
      Saturday at 4pm. It&#39;s 30%full. Got served within 30secs.<br>I Ordered the
      bacon cheeseburger with pickles and side of fries (extra$1 for pickles) . My
      appetizer was deviled eggs . The waiter assured me they have lean beef on all
      there burgers! Not sure if that&#39;s true. <br>My burger came about 10 min&#39;s,
       later my deviled eggs and fries. <br>I always take the bread off as it&#39;s
      filling enough and waste of calories . I ate my burger with a fork. It was tasty
      but not $15 good!<br>My side fries came over cooked $4 too crunchy.<br>Deviled
      eggs well I&#39;ve had better $7<br><br>I do feel Whiskey Cake has better food

      a solid craft cocktail game and have a good selection of local beers on tap.

      to the river walk or up to the road. Has great patio seating to overlook the
      river walk, but with the heat I decided to eat inside. The service was phenomenal
      from the hostess to the server. <br><br>I ordered tableside guacamole to start,
      which was a splendid experience. The server gave great information about every
      step of the process and she was so knowledgeable. She gave a great atmosphere
      to the lunch, making me feel more at home in such an upscale environment. <br><br>For
      my meal, I chose the chicken with rosemary. It came with sauteed spinach, butter
      potatoes, and a to die for shallot reduction sauce. I wanted to devour it and
      yet savor every bite. Very flavorful and moist. The sauce... I would have licked
      the plate if I were in the privacy of my own home.<br><br>The bread and butter
      served with the meal was fantastic, too. You don&#39;t often eat bread and pause
      to think of how fantastic it is. But I definitely did. It was crusty outside
      and soft inside. Just perfect to dip into the shallot sauce. <br><br>Overall,
      while pricey, you get what you pay for. I will happily return for the service,
      view, and food!

  - :body: 'We had heard this place was a great place to dine at but what sealed the
      deal for us was the fact they do nightly dinner cruises. I didn&#39;t know this
      before but you can check out their site and look at the menu for it there so
      you know what you can get. <br><br>The way the tour works is that they load
      up the boat with appetizers, drinks, and salads. Then they go around the loop.
      The next round they pick up the main course and start the tour portion. I can&#39;t
      verify if it&#39;s all the same route or not- I paid 0 attention to where we
      were going and just enjoyed the ride. <br><br>We were at the front of the line
      to get on the boat and they seated us so that we were facing another couple
      and sat a family of four next to us. We all chatted amiably for the entire trip
      and it was fun being so close. We shared a large tableside guacamole with the
      other couple and the family had one to themselves. I&#39;m not sure how many
      people were supposed to share each one but that&#39;s how we ended up dividing
      it up. <br><br>As we ate that, they came to get our orders. I was hesitant to
      get the salmon but I am so glad I did. It was delicious and I feel like it had
      more to it than the surf and turf or was just more filling. Hubby got the turf
      and turf. Ok, I have no idea what they call it but he got chicken and steak
      instead of whatever fish dish they had with the steak. <br><br>This restaurant
      has options for people with allergies and children but they really prefer people
      stick with the main two options if possible. That said, make sure you remind
      them of your allergies. One lady sitting near me had mentioned she couldn&#39;t
      have dairy and they made note of it for the main course and dessert but someone
      else who wasn&#39;t aware brought out a salad with cheese on it. The issue was
      brought to that waiters attention and he promptly took care of the issue, bringing
      them both new salads. So don&#39;t be afraid to speak up! <br><br>The tour was
      a lot of fun and we enjoyed the ride. Our tour guide did a great job. At the
      end you pay your bill. Ours was higher than expected as my husband mistakenly
      thought we each got a complimentary drink and that is not true if it&#39;s alcohol.
      I&#39;m pretty sure a soda is included but don&#39;t quote me on that. Anyway,
      their prickly pear margaritas were amazing (and had apparently won in competitions
      if my tour guide is correct) so I&#39;m glad we tried them. It was a really
      fun experience and we would come back (but drink less!). The food was good enough

  - :body: Man this place was phenomenal! We didn&#39;t have any of the alcohol; however,
      the food is definitely worth it. We didn&#39;t make any reservations, if we
      did we probably would have been able to sit inside. But today was such a nice
      evening that man it was great. Seating and space is a premium for sure.<br><br>Our
      waiter Roger was awesome and the rest of the staff as well. When we were seated
      their management asked if we had been waited on, I kindly said yes. That was
      another plus about eating here. But Roger was attending three to four tables
      including ours and kept up with the fast pace and ensured we were all taken
      care of. Again Roger was awesome and I am glad we had him as our waiter.<br><br>I
      was undecided between the Niman Ranch Double Pork Chops and the Black Angus
      Flank steak. Needless to our waiter Roger led my tapeworm in the right direction.
      I am not a fan of sweet potatoes and man I tried them, and ate most of my plate.
      I definitely ate all my double chop! Before our dinner arrived we ordered their
      guacamole and it was so delicious and made fresh right in front of you. I highly
      recommend it for appetizer if your a guacamole lover. I even ordered a Cesar
      salad, and might I say excellent choice too. Our kids even enjoyed their kid
      meals. <br><br>I will say this, it&#39;s kind of hard to find because their
      sign is covered up by their natural plant that is growing over it. The other
      piece and this needs to go the management, I believe the host/hostess stand
      needs to be in the middle by the walk way of the river walk. From a customer
      perspective, where the stand was placed today it was preventing the wait staff
      from moving in and out freely as they served their customers.

  - :body: Oh em gee. The food here is amazing! <br><br>Started with a prickly pear
      margarita. The drink is as beautiful as the taste. But don&#39;t let the sweetness
      fool you, this drink is a creeper. It was so good, I may or may not have taken
      in too much and ended up with a 3 minute brain freeze... next thing I knew,
      my words started to slur. Can&#39;t have that happening while at dinner with
      coworkers so I didn&#39;t order a second one. Darn it! <br><br>You have to try
      the guacamole. It&#39;s made table side and they can make it as spicy as you
      want with charred serrano peppers. I ate a whole side of the peppers with my
      main meal too and I loved it! There is one very surprising ingredient in the
      guacamole- fresh squeezed orange juice. I know, it sounds weird. But somehow,
      it worked! The chips served with it is freshly fried and salted just right.
      You can taste the freshness. <br><br>I chose the Gulf Seafood platter for my
      main dish and I won&#39;t lie - I ate the entire plate! If you saw how large
      the plate was, you&#39;d be impressed too. You get a little bit of everything.
      Lobster was stuffed and topped with a cheese and breadcrumb crust. Shrimp and
      scallops both grilled just right and seasoned with a hint of spice, served over
      a delicious sauce. Fried oysters with a tart pineapple salsa to cut the richness
      of the dish. Crab cake was very different than anything I&#39;ve had before
      - in the best way possible! And the crawfish pot pie? Ssssoooo good! I&#39;m
      not sure what kind of sauce that was but tasted like a mix of Cajun curry with
      peas, one of my fave veggies. Everything I ate and drank here was perfect. I
      ate here yesterday but had a disappointing dinner tonight so I&#39;m seriously
      considering going back tomorrow again. Just gotta satisfy this craving!

  - :body: Wait was long but that is to be expected at a tourist restaurant on the
      river walk. But once seated, the dim and cozy restaurant was really romantic
      with the candlelight on the small corner side table. We ordered guacamole that
      was made fresh in front of us. It was literally the best guacamole I&#39;ve
      ever had. Then my friend and I shared the seafood platter. It gave you a few
      pieces of all of the seafood that they offered (lobster tail, scallops, grilled
      shrimp, crab cake, fried oyster and crawfish gumbo). The shrimp and the oysters
      were the only things not good, they lacked flavor, had absolutely no taste to
      them. <br><br>This restaurant also had the worst service ever. Our waiter asked
      for our drink order, we told him to bring water and once he got back we would
      be prepared to order food and drinks. He never came back. A bus bit brought
      out waters and that was it. I had to get up and get the server, he said he was
      waiting on us to call him back over. Like your job is to cone check on us. He
      took our order and that was it, after about 20mins waiting our guacamole was
      made then after that food came out. And none of these points did our server
      bring the food or ask how it was once we had it. He later brought us out bread
      and butter towards the end of our meal, which was a complete joke. I wouldn&#39;t
      mind going back but that service is not acceptable, he literally started being
      nice when we asked for our bill, trying to make sure he does enough for a tip
      at this point.

  - :body: From out of the mouths of babes, what a phenomenal experience for our taste
      buds! To be frank, writing this review still makes my mouth water and for good
      reason. Here we go!<br><br>For starters, make sure to call ahead of time and
      place a reservation. We were good setting it early in the day and this proved
      advantageous over those who decided to try walking on in and get informed about
      the 1-2 hour long wait before getting a seat. Parking can be tricky as well
      in the downtown area, so I also recommend getting there early to park further
      and give yourself time to walk, preferably near an entrance to the Riverwalk
      to make it more enjoyable and less exposure in the sun. We showed up on a Friday
      late evening, combined with summer time, the Riverwalk was shoulder-to-shoulder
      traffic but the food was worth it. Getting there, we waited a few minutes while
      they prepped seating outside for our party. This is no indoor voice venue, this
      is speak-your-mind-I-can&#39;t-hear-you-but-that&#39;s-okay kind of vibes rollin&#39;
      around. The vibe around the Riverwalk is generally filled with the sounds of
      mariachi, jazz, and other commotion so don&#39;t be surprised to hear various
      things going on.<br><br>Our server came over as quick as she could, what with
      the many guests also dining in. We ordered the Blackened Prime Rib as well as
      the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail for an appetizer. After taking our order, admittedly,
      there was quite a wait, but looking around, it was completely understandable.
      Providing us bread and chips to munch on, our server came around every so often
      to make sure we had everything we needed, bless her heart and busy feet. The
      outside seating actually was much more enjoyable despite how tight the spacing
      was, as opposed to the inside as this allowed us to people watch, enjoy outdoor
      conversation and the warm summer evenings of San Antonio with refreshing drinks.<br><br>The
      Blackened Prime Rib, recommended medium rare, was absolutely mouth watering.
      Laid on a bed of spring vegetables, each cut was juicy and melted with a delicious
      amount of herbs and flavor! It would kind of melt on the tongue and would stay
      there the entire meal which was delightful. Complemented with the Jumbo Shrimp
      Cocktail, this was both refreshing and a fun dish to be had. We definitely had
      our surf-n-turf and it was presented inside a half-cut of cucumber that was
      filled with two different sauces and then laid on a bed of pickled vegetables.
      Whatever you do, don&#39;t forget to eat the whole cucumber! It&#39;s more than
      just a placeholder for the shrimp, it&#39;s refreshing!<br>They do have an option
      to dine floating right along the river with a party of friends but keep in mind
      this comes with a hefty price. Gotta admit, the thought of eating steak while
      floating and avoiding all that foot traffic isn&#39;t such a bad idea though...<br><br>After
      everything was said and done, this american/seafood cuisine we enjoyed was a
      pretty penny and did have quite a wait despite understanding the busy weekend
      atmosphere. The food was fantastic as it was bougie and I would recommend this
      place to anyone coming to check our San Antonio and the Riverwalk anytime. Sometimes,
      being patient pays off and in this case, it was a BIG payoff!

      and it was fun being so close. We shared a large tableside guacamole with the
      other couple and the family had one to themselves. I&#39;m not sure how many
      people were supposed to share each one but that&#39;s how we ended up dividing
      it up. <br><br>As we ate that, they came to get our orders. I was hesitant to
      get the salmon but I am so glad I did. It was delicious and I feel like it had
      more to it than the surf and turf or was just more filling. Hubby got the turf
      and turf. Ok, I have no idea what they call it but he got chicken and steak
      instead of whatever fish dish they had with the steak. <br><br>This restaurant
      has options for people with allergies and children but they really prefer people
      stick with the main two options if possible. That said, make sure you remind
      them of your allergies. One lady sitting near me had mentioned she couldn&#39;t
      have dairy and they made note of it for the main course and dessert but someone
      else who wasn&#39;t aware brought out a salad with cheese on it. The issue was
      brought to that waiters attention and he promptly took care of the issue, bringing
      them both new salads. So don&#39;t be afraid to speak up! <br><br>The tour was
      a lot of fun and we enjoyed the ride. Our tour guide did a great job. At the
      end you pay your bill. Ours was higher than expected as my husband mistakenly
      thought we each got a complimentary drink and that is not true if it&#39;s alcohol.
      I&#39;m pretty sure a soda is included but don&#39;t quote me on that. Anyway,
      their prickly pear margaritas were amazing (and had apparently won in competitions
      if my tour guide is correct) so I&#39;m glad we tried them. It was a really

      the food is definitely worth it. We didn&#39;t make any reservations, if we
      did we probably would have been able to sit inside. But today was such a nice

      waiter Roger was awesome and the rest of the staff as well. When we were seated
      their management asked if we had been waited on, I kindly said yes. That was
      another plus about eating here. But Roger was attending three to four tables
      including ours and kept up with the fast pace and ensured we were all taken
      care of. Again Roger was awesome and I am glad we had him as our waiter.<br><br>I
      was undecided between the Niman Ranch Double Pork Chops and the Black Angus
      Flank steak. Needless to our waiter Roger led my tapeworm in the right direction.
      I am not a fan of sweet potatoes and man I tried them, and ate most of my plate.
      I definitely ate all my double chop! Before our dinner arrived we ordered their
      guacamole and it was so delicious and made fresh right in front of you. I highly
      recommend it for appetizer if your a guacamole lover. I even ordered a Cesar
      salad, and might I say excellent choice too. Our kids even enjoyed their kid
      meals. <br><br>I will say this, it&#39;s kind of hard to find because their
      sign is covered up by their natural plant that is growing over it. The other
      piece and this needs to go the management, I believe the host/hostess stand
      needs to be in the middle by the walk way of the river walk. From a customer
      perspective, where the stand was placed today it was preventing the wait staff
      from moving in and out freely as they served their customers.

    :comment: Gulf Seafood Platter
    :body: Oh em gee. The food here is amazing! <br><br>Started with a prickly pear
      margarita. The drink is as beautiful as the taste. But don&#39;t let the sweetness
      fool you, this drink is a creeper. It was so good, I may or may not have taken
      in too much and ended up with a 3 minute brain freeze... next thing I knew,
      my words started to slur. Can&#39;t have that happening while at dinner with
      coworkers so I didn&#39;t order a second one. Darn it! <br><br>You have to try
      the guacamole. It&#39;s made table side and they can make it as spicy as you
      want with charred serrano peppers. I ate a whole side of the peppers with my
      main meal too and I loved it! There is one very surprising ingredient in the
      guacamole- fresh squeezed orange juice. I know, it sounds weird. But somehow,
      it worked! The chips served with it is freshly fried and salted just right.
      You can taste the freshness. <br><br>I chose the Gulf Seafood platter for my
      main dish and I won&#39;t lie - I ate the entire plate! If you saw how large
      the plate was, you&#39;d be impressed too. You get a little bit of everything.
      Lobster was stuffed and topped with a cheese and breadcrumb crust. Shrimp and
      scallops both grilled just right and seasoned with a hint of spice, served over
      a delicious sauce. Fried oysters with a tart pineapple salsa to cut the richness
      of the dish. Crab cake was very different than anything I&#39;ve had before
      - in the best way possible! And the crawfish pot pie? Ssssoooo good! I&#39;m
      not sure what kind of sauce that was but tasted like a mix of Cajun curry with
      peas, one of my fave veggies. Everything I ate and drank here was perfect. I
      ate here yesterday but had a disappointing dinner tonight so I&#39;m seriously
      considering going back tomorrow again. Just gotta satisfy this craving!

    :comment: Prickly Pear Margarita
    :body: Oh em gee. The food here is amazing! <br><br>Started with a prickly pear
      margarita. The drink is as beautiful as the taste. But don&#39;t let the sweetness
      fool you, this drink is a creeper. It was so good, I may or may not have taken
      in too much and ended up with a 3 minute brain freeze... next thing I knew,
      my words started to slur. Can&#39;t have that happening while at dinner with
      coworkers so I didn&#39;t order a second one. Darn it! <br><br>You have to try
      the guacamole. It&#39;s made table side and they can make it as spicy as you
      want with charred serrano peppers. I ate a whole side of the peppers with my
      main meal too and I loved it! There is one very surprising ingredient in the
      guacamole- fresh squeezed orange juice. I know, it sounds weird. But somehow,
      it worked! The chips served with it is freshly fried and salted just right.
      You can taste the freshness. <br><br>I chose the Gulf Seafood platter for my
      main dish and I won&#39;t lie - I ate the entire plate! If you saw how large
      the plate was, you&#39;d be impressed too. You get a little bit of everything.
      Lobster was stuffed and topped with a cheese and breadcrumb crust. Shrimp and
      scallops both grilled just right and seasoned with a hint of spice, served over
      a delicious sauce. Fried oysters with a tart pineapple salsa to cut the richness
      of the dish. Crab cake was very different than anything I&#39;ve had before
      - in the best way possible! And the crawfish pot pie? Ssssoooo good! I&#39;m

    :comment: Table side guacamole cart
    :body: Wait was long but that is to be expected at a tourist restaurant on the
      river walk. But once seated, the dim and cozy restaurant was really romantic
      with the candlelight on the small corner side table. We ordered guacamole that
      was made fresh in front of us. It was literally the best guacamole I&#39;ve
      ever had. Then my friend and I shared the seafood platter. It gave you a few
      pieces of all of the seafood that they offered (lobster tail, scallops, grilled
      shrimp, crab cake, fried oyster and crawfish gumbo). The shrimp and the oysters
      were the only things not good, they lacked flavor, had absolutely no taste to
      them. <br><br>This restaurant also had the worst service ever. Our waiter asked
      for our drink order, we told him to bring water and once he got back we would
      be prepared to order food and drinks. He never came back. A bus bit brought
      out waters and that was it. I had to get up and get the server, he said he was
      waiting on us to call him back over. Like your job is to cone check on us. He
      took our order and that was it, after about 20mins waiting our guacamole was
      made then after that food came out. And none of these points did our server
      bring the food or ask how it was once we had it. He later brought us out bread
      and butter towards the end of our meal, which was a complete joke. I wouldn&#39;t
      mind going back but that service is not acceptable, he literally started being
      nice when we asked for our bill, trying to make sure he does enough for a tip
      at this point.

    :comment: Shrimp cocktail in cucumber!
    :body: From out of the mouths of babes, what a phenomenal experience for our taste
      buds! To be frank, writing this review still makes my mouth water and for good
      reason. Here we go!<br><br>For starters, make sure to call ahead of time and
      place a reservation. We were good setting it early in the day and this proved
      advantageous over those who decided to try walking on in and get informed about
      the 1-2 hour long wait before getting a seat. Parking can be tricky as well
      in the downtown area, so I also recommend getting there early to park further
      and give yourself time to walk, preferably near an entrance to the Riverwalk
      to make it more enjoyable and less exposure in the sun. We showed up on a Friday
      late evening, combined with summer time, the Riverwalk was shoulder-to-shoulder
      traffic but the food was worth it. Getting there, we waited a few minutes while
      they prepped seating outside for our party. This is no indoor voice venue, this
      is speak-your-mind-I-can&#39;t-hear-you-but-that&#39;s-okay kind of vibes rollin&#39;
      around. The vibe around the Riverwalk is generally filled with the sounds of
      mariachi, jazz, and other commotion so don&#39;t be surprised to hear various
      things going on.<br><br>Our server came over as quick as she could, what with
      the many guests also dining in. We ordered the Blackened Prime Rib as well as
      the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail for an appetizer. After taking our order, admittedly,
      there was quite a wait, but looking around, it was completely understandable.
      Providing us bread and chips to munch on, our server came around every so often
      to make sure we had everything we needed, bless her heart and busy feet. The
      outside seating actually was much more enjoyable despite how tight the spacing
      was, as opposed to the inside as this allowed us to people watch, enjoy outdoor
      conversation and the warm summer evenings of San Antonio with refreshing drinks.<br><br>The
      Blackened Prime Rib, recommended medium rare, was absolutely mouth watering.
      Laid on a bed of spring vegetables, each cut was juicy and melted with a delicious
      amount of herbs and flavor! It would kind of melt on the tongue and would stay
      there the entire meal which was delightful. Complemented with the Jumbo Shrimp
      Cocktail, this was both refreshing and a fun dish to be had. We definitely had
      our surf-n-turf and it was presented inside a half-cut of cucumber that was
      filled with two different sauces and then laid on a bed of pickled vegetables.
      Whatever you do, don&#39;t forget to eat the whole cucumber! It&#39;s more than
      just a placeholder for the shrimp, it&#39;s refreshing!<br>They do have an option
      to dine floating right along the river with a party of friends but keep in mind
      this comes with a hefty price. Gotta admit, the thought of eating steak while
      floating and avoiding all that foot traffic isn&#39;t such a bad idea though...<br><br>After
      everything was said and done, this american/seafood cuisine we enjoyed was a
      pretty penny and did have quite a wait despite understanding the busy weekend
      atmosphere. The food was fantastic as it was bougie and I would recommend this

      place, this is not the place to go<br>- It&#39;s loud and a bit hectic inside,

      and it was a TINY portion of eggs...felt like I got cheated on portion size

      thanks DDD! It has a flavor profile that&#39;s just makes it subtly better than
      other corned beef hashes I&#39;ve had in the past. Hard to describe, it&#39;s
      just a very balanced and delicious plate. I prefer to order with over-easy or
      sunny side up eggs to get the yolk mixed in. Also, for the first time, I tried

    :body: Definitely one of, if not, the best corned beef hash I&#39;ve ever had;
      thanks DDD! It has a flavor profile that&#39;s just makes it subtly better than
      other corned beef hashes I&#39;ve had in the past. Hard to describe, it&#39;s
      just a very balanced and delicious plate. I prefer to order with over-easy or
      sunny side up eggs to get the yolk mixed in. Also, for the first time, I tried
      their Wednesday Chicken and waffles special. The fried chicken was pretty amazing.
      The waffle was made well and held it&#39;s crispy texture and the savory syrup

  - :body: It&#39;s about dang time I got to try San Antonio&#39;s Triple D Food Network
      renowned Pizzería!!!  Let me tell you, I&#39;ve been on a semi carb free diet
      these past few years so clearly, Pizza was not on my menu. I broke down today
      (ok, and last week) when I decided to take my boss to this place for dinner.
      Luckily, he is a pizza aficionado so it worked out well.<br><br>We came on a
      Wednesday evening and this place was hopping! We decided on red wine and a locally
      brewed beer which my boss enjoyed. We paired our drinks with the Burrata Sampler
      which was orgasmically good (as far as I&#39;m concerned). The mozzarella stuffed
      with truffles was my absolute favorite! The cheeses went well with the prosciutto
      and the cherry tomatoes drizzled with olive oil.<br><br>If this wasn&#39;t enough,
      we also decided try one of their Food Network acclaimed pizzas- pulled prosciutto
      with mushrooms, fontina, roasted bell peppers and creamy sauce. Oh....so good!
      You could have seriously compared us to two little piggies who ate their way
      through Dough! <br><br>As mentioned, we came on a Wednesday so parking outside
      the strip was not bad. With that said, every table at Dough was taken by 6:30
      PM. Can&#39;t imagine what this place looks like on a Friday or Saturday! <br><br>I
      was happily satisfied with my Dough experience. Service was great and food was
      phenomenal! I&#39;m not going to lie and say this will be my pizza go to going
      forward considering the price BUT I can confidently say that this is a locally
      owned 5 star restaurant that I&#39;d highly recommend to anyone who has cravings
      for great pizza!

      I miss most about my home town. Eight years in San Antonio and I still get these
      intense pizza cravings only to be disappointed. But wait!  Dough!!!  We first
      came here a few years ago and had a great experience but it&#39;s a little far
      so it&#39;s not first on my list. Well now it is. What a fantastic experience.
      We ended up sitting in the bar area because the wait was a bit long for tables.
      We met great people, drank fantastic wine and then, the burrata followed by
      pizza. We ordered the margherita with peppers, mushrooms and onions. They cook
      the latter in balsamic which combines with the sweetnesses of the peppers and
      the acid of the tomatoes to produce, well, nirvana. I&#39;m not messing around
      anymore. When I want pizza I&#39;ll be at Dough<br><br>(8-2-19) I&#39;m so sorry
      I have to update this review. We just had a horrible experience. After a tough
      week, ordered the same pizza I mentioned above for delivery. What we received
      (see photos) was somehow both burnt and under-cooked, with very little cheese
      but WAY too much of the other toppings. Very very disappointed. Shouldn&#39;t
      have to drag my tired bones in to get good quality.

      care of us, offering several delicious recommendations.<br><br>We ended up starting
      with a super fresh Tuscan salad which was followed with arguably one of the
      best bufula margherita pizzas I&#39;ve had in the States. I had spent a year
      abroad, mostly in Italy, and Dough Pizzeria makes a &#39;vera pizza napoletana&#39;
      at probably the best value. Finally, we topped it off with a delicious affogato,
      which wasn&#39;t even on the menu but they were willing to make it upon request.

      about a similar behavior against a cell phone company....and the company lost.
      Yes it&#39;s only$.02, but if they take this from every customer, every day,

      game. It was located in a shopping mall, and had an adorable little patio fully
      equipped with heaters and even blankets on the chairs! What a simple but great
      touch. It was a chilly day but the patio was perfect with the heaters on. The
      tables are a bit crammed together but after eating here I get why-EVERYONE WANTS
      IT! <br><br>We ordered a bottle of an Italian red, an Aglianico, and it was
      delicious. Dry and robust and at a great price (around $30) plus it paired well
      with the food! <br><br>To start we had the truffle burrata. Omg. OMG. GO GET
      IT. Now. It was what dreams are made of. The balsamic reduction and tri colored
      cherry tomatoes were PERFECT adding acidity and brightness to the creamy deliciousness
      that is burrata. I&#39;m drooling just thinking about it.  The app is quite
      big so the $20 price tag was definitely worth every cent! <br><br>For our main
      we split the prosciutto and housemade sausage with ricotta and basil pizza.
      It was FANTASTIC, real Neapolitan authentic pizza, not that Americanized crap
      most people think of as pizza. We were stuffed with the app and splitting a
      pizza so we didn&#39;t get dessert but man it was one of the best if not THE
      best pizza I&#39;ve had. I also got macchiato and the bf got an americano-im
      not huge on coffee but it was the best coffee I&#39;ve had! He said the same
      for his Americano and he drinks coffee religiously!! Our server was friendly

      your regular pizza place. I think what sets them apart is their use of fresh
      ingredients that are sourced locally. They also use real wood fired brick ovens.
      We decided to start with the Poco Pane pronounced Poco Panyay. It&#39;s a flatbread
      served with their house made marinara and it was delicious. We should have stopped
      there but we ordered the Bufala Margherita pizza instead. Once again everything
      is fresh and sourced locally or made in the store and the pizza was very enjoyable.
      Our server, Jewels was very attentive and knowledgeable, answering questions
      we had about the different items on the menu. I think if you&#39;re looking
      for great pizza, Dough is a cant miss.

      for that friend right about now! <br><br>We had the mozzarella sampler and I&#39;ve
      never had anything quite like it. There were three balls of mozzarella cheese
      all stuffed with like a creamy cheese. One had pesto on top with a balsamic
      reduction (Personal fav), one had a truffle flavor in the creamy center and
      the other had sun dried tomatoes. The appetizer was beautiful and also had some
      prosciutto and tomatoes on the platter. Delicious cheese experience!<br><br>The
      pizza: I had the Pork Love pizza. It&#39;s basically a meat lovers pizza but
      it was a little different. The Italian meats tasted fresh. Like they just sliced
      them in the back fresh. They were also salty (in the best way), not too greasy,
      and had a slight crisp to the tops of them from the high heat oven.   <br><br>I
      will say this place isn&#39;t cheap. It was $20 for a 11 inch pizza, but it
      also tasted like a $20 pizza. It&#39;s not your standard delivery pizza but

    :body: So I&#39;m from Chicago. Pizza is in my blood. It&#39;s one of the things
      I miss most about my home town. Eight years in San Antonio and I still get these
      intense pizza cravings only to be disappointed. But wait!  Dough!!!  We first
      came here a few years ago and had a great experience but it&#39;s a little far
      so it&#39;s not first on my list. Well now it is. What a fantastic experience.
      We ended up sitting in the bar area because the wait was a bit long for tables.
      We met great people, drank fantastic wine and then, the burrata followed by
      pizza. We ordered the margherita with peppers, mushrooms and onions. They cook
      the latter in balsamic which combines with the sweetnesses of the peppers and
      the acid of the tomatoes to produce, well, nirvana. I&#39;m not messing around
      anymore. When I want pizza I&#39;ll be at Dough<br><br>(8-2-19) I&#39;m so sorry
      I have to update this review. We just had a horrible experience. After a tough
      week, ordered the same pizza I mentioned above for delivery. What we received
      (see photos) was somehow both burnt and under-cooked, with very little cheese
      but WAY too much of the other toppings. Very very disappointed. Shouldn&#39;t
      have to drag my tired bones in to get good quality.

      about a similar behavior against a cell phone company....and the company lost.
      Yes it&#39;s only$.02, but if they take this from every customer, every day,
      this is a LOT of money. If I eat here a lot, this could be a good amount of
      money. I&#39;m pretty upset about this.

    :comment: Truffle burrata AKA food of the Gods. GET IT.
    :body: My bf and I had an amazing lunch here before going to the Thunder v Spurs
      game. It was located in a shopping mall, and had an adorable little patio fully
      equipped with heaters and even blankets on the chairs! What a simple but great
      touch. It was a chilly day but the patio was perfect with the heaters on. The
      tables are a bit crammed together but after eating here I get why-EVERYONE WANTS
      IT! <br><br>We ordered a bottle of an Italian red, an Aglianico, and it was
      delicious. Dry and robust and at a great price (around $30) plus it paired well
      with the food! <br><br>To start we had the truffle burrata. Omg. OMG. GO GET
      IT. Now. It was what dreams are made of. The balsamic reduction and tri colored
      cherry tomatoes were PERFECT adding acidity and brightness to the creamy deliciousness
      that is burrata. I&#39;m drooling just thinking about it.  The app is quite
      big so the $20 price tag was definitely worth every cent! <br><br>For our main
      we split the prosciutto and housemade sausage with ricotta and basil pizza.
      It was FANTASTIC, real Neapolitan authentic pizza, not that Americanized crap
      most people think of as pizza. We were stuffed with the app and splitting a
      pizza so we didn&#39;t get dessert but man it was one of the best if not THE
      best pizza I&#39;ve had. I also got macchiato and the bf got an americano-im
      not huge on coffee but it was the best coffee I&#39;ve had! He said the same
      for his Americano and he drinks coffee religiously!! Our server was friendly
      and efficient, she had multiple tables but still helped with our food and wine
      choices. <br><br>We will ALWAYS come to Dough when we are in the area!

      We decided to start with the Poco Pane pronounced Poco Panyay. It&#39;s a flatbread
      served with their house made marinara and it was delicious. We should have stopped
      there but we ordered the Bufala Margherita pizza instead. Once again everything
      is fresh and sourced locally or made in the store and the pizza was very enjoyable.

      to wait outside in the parking lot for an hour. It was rough. There was a line
      of people out the door! <br><br>Chips and salsa were really good. It&#39;s a
      darker salsa but had great flavor. <br><br>We had the chicken fajitas and they
      were juicy and fresh as can be! Everything about our food was delicious. <br><br>As
      soon as the sun down, the places turned into a party. It was so loud with music
      that you couldn&#39;t even hear the person next to you.

  - :body: Not sure why, but everyone visiting me in San Antonio wants to go to this
      restaurant and yesterday, 9/11/2019, was no exception.<br><br>The food is always
      lukewarm and underwhelming.  The chips and salsa are the only bright spot.  Even
      the servers I&#39;ve had are nondescript and not very personable.<br><br>To
      make matters worse on this visit, it was 102 degrees outside and not much cooler
      inside.  My dear friend was wearing shorts and actually sticking to the seat!
       Ice water would melt quickly and we had to wave down the server for refills.
       My wife&#39;s ribeye steak was gristly and fatty; so much so that it was sent
      back.  We called a manager over about the heat and he said the A/C Was being
      repaired and they only had a fan running.  This must be a recurring problem,
      because we were at this same spot in June, for a graduation, and again, it was
      super hot and muggy inside with mediocre food.<br><br>Really not trying to complain,
      but rather give an honest review.  We&#39;ve been in San Antonio since 2010
      after being around the world in military travels, but have never personally
      chosen this restaurant.  Still, we&#39;ve been here at least a dozen times because
      of Air Force graduations, school graduations, birthdays and visiting friends
      reading Yelp! reviews.  We don&#39;t even care for the fajitas...steak or chicken...which
      is saying something.<br><br>I would recommend other spots like Chuy&#39;s, Lupe
      Tortilla, Paloma Blanco or this food truck called Paella.  Chuys&#39;s has an
      awesome Happy Hour, great chips and salsa and an electric atmosphere with great
      outdoor seating (if desired).  Lupe Tortilla has awesome tableside quacamole,
      fajitas and believe it or not beef ribs!  Yup, beef ribs!  Paloma Blanca has
      an upscale feel where the waiting room is like being in someone&#39;s home;
      complete with leather sofa, coffee table, end tables, fireplace and other seating.
       Outdoor area is extensive and usable since there are tons of misting fans.
      Paella has generous portions of tasty goodness; can&#39;t go wrong with any
      choice at all. <br><br>Hope this helps you all decide.  I come from an international
      family, military career and am both a chef and foodie...If you still decide
      to try Rosarios, just know that I tried to help:)  Good luck and happy eating!

  - :body: A good friend of mine used to live in San Antonio and she said her favorite
      restaurant in the city is Rosario&#39;s.  I take personal suggestions seriously,
      so I came and checked it out.  It is situated in the downtown area.  The parking
      lot was full, but we found even better street parking right out front.  The
      restaurant is huge and still was pretty packed on a weekday.  We were lucky
      enough to get seated right away though.  The ambiance is classy, somewhat upscale
      dining.  Not your typical Tex-Mex establishment or menu.  Our service from start
      to finish was awesome.  We were out in the heat and thirsty, and the drinks
      were constantly flowing.  <br><br>We started off with the shishito peppers as
      an app.  It&#39;s a popular app at many establishments these days.  It has a
      little bite to it, but you really get the nice pepper taste without it being
      too harsh.  Be aware because every few peppers packs some real heat.  I was
      not too terribly hungry so I ordered the Tacos Nortenos which ended up being
      super filling anyways.  It reminded me more of a quesadilla than a taco.  Someone
      else ordered an actual quesadilla and our plates looked very similar.  Everything
      we tried was delicious.  I needed something with a little kick to go with the
      food and there was not too many options for that other than straight jalapenos.
       We didn&#39;t have much room for dessert, but the selection looked good.<br><br>I
      will definitely keep this in my San Antonio rotation and bring an appetite next

      Yah. You can tell they make their food with love. Lots and lots of love. <br>The
      pickled onions are hashtag bomb on this avo toast. <br>We grabbed a few baked
      goods, of course one then being the tequila croissant. Very, very rich and the

      dinner, though I have not done that yet). I have never had a bad meal here.
      The salads are the best. But the bread and pastries are always perfectly-baked
      and delicious. Feels like I am back at a bakery in Mexico City. I also have
      never had better and more consistently solid service. The managers, the servers,
      the cashiers--all next level good. <br><br>The line is bad sometimes, yes. But
      if you go before noon or after 1, the line is more than manageable. Regardless,
      even at peak hours, it moves quickly and tables flip just the same. <br><br>I
      cannot speak highly enough about this place. If Panera, Mexico City, and a local
      coffee shop had a love child, it would look just like La Panadería.

      so expect a wait. I would have giving 5 stars but it was a bit disappointing
      that after waiting in line to get the food we then had to just stand around
      and wait for a table. When you walk in you wait in line and they have a self
      serve concept. You grab your tray and you pick which bakery items you would
      like to try then you get to the register and you either pay for the items ordered
      or you order additional items that will be delivered to your table. You pay
      get a number and start hunting for a table. We got a few bakery items and food.
      Some of the bakery items lacked filling so they tasted a bit dry but overall
      they were all tasty. The food on the other hand was stellar and no one talked
      while they stuffed their face (always a great sign). It was a great experience
      and I will for sure be back.

      bridge). It had a very chic farmhouse style atmosphere inside. The bakery and
      kitchen had an open layout which allowed customers to see all the action in
      the kitchen. There was also an ample amount of seating areas in the restaurant.
      I like to stop here for dessert after lunch when im downtown.  One of my favorite
      dessert&#39;s to get is the chocolate mousse cake which they sell individually
      if you just want a small  treat. This also a great place to stop by if you want

      in here is worth the wait. Your biggest problem is not asking for one each of
      the amazing pastries on display and perpetually refreshed during the morning
      rush. Key Lime Cruffin? Tequila Almond Croissant? Apple empanada? All of the
      above.<br><br>What a well-oiled machine this place is! Efficient and pleasant
      staff, food is served piping hot, the coffee and espresso drinks are rich and
      smooth. Enormous portions to boot. We would split entrees next time and nobody
      would leave the table hungry. I so wish we would have made time for dinner,
      but there are too many choices in San Antonio to double up on even one restaurant
      during a weeklong visit. <br><br>I ordered Avocado Toast which was pretty much
      a meal by itself, so the El Mexicano breakfast I also got was overkill...but
      in a good way. Husband had El Favorito breakfast with hot chocolate. I had a
      latte served in what would be a soup bowl at most other restaurants. It was
      smooth and rich and expertly crafted. <br><br>After trying a couple places on
      the Riverwalk for breakfast and left wanting more, I have to say this is a place
      that should not be missed.

      and a breakfast/brunch lunch spot.<br><br>The interior is rustic, spacious,
      and well designed. After walking in, as long as you read, it&#39;s understandable
      how they operate; they have a &#34;build your own&#34; option and regular menu
      offerings as well.<br><br>I ordered the &#34;El Mexicano&#34; which is a vegan
      plate, but I added bacon... because well, BACON. The dish came out way better
      presented on the plate than i was expecting, it looked really good. Everything
      tasted delicious and fresh! The scrambled eggs had a combination of jalapenos,
      tomato, and onion was perfect for me, on a bead of bread (Country Loaf Sourdough).
      The bread was actually quite freaking amazing, I was full and couldn&#39;t eat
      it all and felt bag I couldn&#39;t, but it was fantastic.<br><br>While eating,
      I saw the menu had coffee, and more specifically, Cortados! I&#39;m from Miami,
      visiting San Antonio, so I was curious what it must taste like half way across
      the U.S. I ordered once and it tasted really good, just not like a corrado,
      more like a small cappuccino. I&#39;m not sure if it was the strength, the cinnamon
      taste, or what, but it definitely didn&#39;t represent the kind of cortado I&#39;m
      used to, but at least it tasted good and I enjoyed it!<br><br>I definitely recommend

      bridge). It had a very chic farmhouse style atmosphere inside. The bakery and
      kitchen had an open layout which allowed customers to see all the action in
      the kitchen. There was also an ample amount of seating areas in the restaurant.
      I like to stop here for dessert after lunch when im downtown.  One of my favorite
      dessert&#39;s to get is the chocolate mousse cake which they sell individually
      if you just want a small  treat. This also a great place to stop by if you want

      table promptly to what look like the best table in the house. Center stage.
      Even my husband exclaimed a quiet &#34;wow&#34; when we arrived at the table.
      Thank you so much. I don&#39;t know how we deserved such an honor, but gladly
      we sat.    <br><br>My husband and I had the Chef&#39;s Tasting Menu accompanied
      with Wine Pairings. This was simply an exquisite dining experience capping off
      at 3 hours. Le Bernardin uses the finest local ingredients matching them with
      the freshest seafood in order to create extraordinary art cuisines. Beginning
      with the first course: Caviar Tartare. Biting into this, you can sense that
      it didn&#39;t come from an ordinary jar of caviar, but Osetra Caviar. One of
      the most prized caviar in the world. The rich, buttery flavor of these little
      pearls popping in your mouth really set the mood of what would be an evening
      of gastronomic adventure. From the caviar, we moved to Seared Langoustine next.
      Just like the caviar, I had never tasted langoustine this sweet or even remotely
      this succulent before. The most visual for me was the size of this langoustine.
      It was the size of a colossal prawn. In fact, nothing here was ordinary. Every
      course was a prelude to an even more pleasing edible work of art. Eight courses
      plus 2 additional complimentary offerings. Please (if you haven&#39;t done so)
      do scroll down and look at the pictures below.<br><br>Just like the food, the
      Wine Pairings were exceptional. The one that stood out for me the most was Krug
      Grande Cuvée 167ÈME Édition, paired with Sautéed Dover Sole. I&#39;ve seen this
      in the wine stores, but never had the pleasure of consuming it. At $180 a bottle
      in my local wine store, it&#39;s not something I would even think about buying,
      but at Le Bernardin, it&#39;s part of the Wine Pairings. I think we showed too
      much enthusiasm when the lovely Sommelier showed us the bottle and poured each
      of us a glass because she actually came back a few minutes later to pour us
      more! <br><br>Le Bernardin currently sits at # 36 on The World&#39;s 50 Best
      Restaurants. Since 2005, it has earned the coveted and well deserved 3 Michelin
      stars. Although we did not see Chef Eric Ripert that evening, we were visited
      by Ben Chekroun, Directeur de Salle, who has been here for 26 years. He came
      over to say hello and to make sure we were having a pleasant evening. His gesture
      was quite sincere. I think if one of us had said we LOVED the Krug Grande Cuvée,
      he probably would&#39;ve poured us more himself. Little touches like this really
      make a difference.  <br><br>As the evening wore on, the exceptional service
      bestowed on us, the generous pours of wine pairings from the lovely and knowledgeable
      Sommelier, and savoring these artistically plated works of art...we were in
      our own little world. There are few chefs quite as celebrated as Eric Ripert,
      and on this visit, our expectations were met on every level. Definitely worth
      the special journey.'

    :comment: Wine Pairings with our Chef&#39;s Tasting Menu.
    :body: 'It was a Friday night, 8 o&#39;clock reservation. We were taken to our
      table promptly to what look like the best table in the house. Center stage.
      Even my husband exclaimed a quiet &#34;wow&#34; when we arrived at the table.
      Thank you so much. I don&#39;t know how we deserved such an honor, but gladly
      we sat.    <br><br>My husband and I had the Chef&#39;s Tasting Menu accompanied
      with Wine Pairings. This was simply an exquisite dining experience capping off
      at 3 hours. Le Bernardin uses the finest local ingredients matching them with
      the freshest seafood in order to create extraordinary art cuisines. Beginning
      with the first course: Caviar Tartare. Biting into this, you can sense that
      it didn&#39;t come from an ordinary jar of caviar, but Osetra Caviar. One of
      the most prized caviar in the world. The rich, buttery flavor of these little
      pearls popping in your mouth really set the mood of what would be an evening
      of gastronomic adventure. From the caviar, we moved to Seared Langoustine next.
      Just like the caviar, I had never tasted langoustine this sweet or even remotely
      this succulent before. The most visual for me was the size of this langoustine.
      It was the size of a colossal prawn. In fact, nothing here was ordinary. Every
      course was a prelude to an even more pleasing edible work of art. Eight courses
      plus 2 additional complimentary offerings. Please (if you haven&#39;t done so)
      do scroll down and look at the pictures below.<br><br>Just like the food, the
      Wine Pairings were exceptional. The one that stood out for me the most was Krug
      Grande Cuvée 167ÈME Édition, paired with Sautéed Dover Sole. I&#39;ve seen this
      in the wine stores, but never had the pleasure of consuming it. At $180 a bottle
      in my local wine store, it&#39;s not something I would even think about buying,
      but at Le Bernardin, it&#39;s part of the Wine Pairings. I think we showed too
      much enthusiasm when the lovely Sommelier showed us the bottle and poured each
      of us a glass because she actually came back a few minutes later to pour us
      more! <br><br>Le Bernardin currently sits at # 36 on The World&#39;s 50 Best
      Restaurants. Since 2005, it has earned the coveted and well deserved 3 Michelin
      stars. Although we did not see Chef Eric Ripert that evening, we were visited
      by Ben Chekroun, Directeur de Salle, who has been here for 26 years. He came
      over to say hello and to make sure we were having a pleasant evening. His gesture
      was quite sincere. I think if one of us had said we LOVED the Krug Grande Cuvée,
      he probably would&#39;ve poured us more himself. Little touches like this really
      make a difference.  <br><br>As the evening wore on, the exceptional service
      bestowed on us, the generous pours of wine pairings from the lovely and knowledgeable
      Sommelier, and savoring these artistically plated works of art...we were in
      our own little world. There are few chefs quite as celebrated as Eric Ripert,
      and on this visit, our expectations were met on every level. Definitely worth
      the special journey.'

      Walking this bridge in the middle of summer, I knew I would need water. I BROUGHT
      A BOTTLE. This is why I didn&#39;t buy the ONE DOLLAR bottle when I started
      walking from the Manhattan side. Okay hello? It was so hot that I finished my
      water about half way through!! The water on the Brooklyn side was $3!!! So instead
      I opted for a $7 smoothie from a cart...<br><br>Anyway...the views were so beautiful
      and the walk isn&#39;t that long. The view of the skyline is great and you can
      see the teensy Statue of Liberty too! I will say, it does get a bit confusing
      to know where to walk from/get dropped off at. I believe the entrance is right
      by the subway exit. If it&#39;s sunny, make sure to put on sunscreen, bring
      a hat, bring sunglasses, or whatever sun protection you have! Once you&#39;re
      in Brooklyn, it&#39;s a super quick walk to the Dumbo Waterfront, another great
      place to take pictures!

    :comment: Sour Cherry Pie
    :body: My new favorite bakery. So good that it&#39;ll be one of my must visits
      every single time I&#39;m in NYC. <br><br>We went out to Two Little Red Hens
      in search of the best New York cheesecake. We&#39;d also heard lots of great
      reviews of their Brooklyn Blackout cupcakes and were excited to try those too.
      <br><br>We got there around 11.45am or so and bad news - no cheesecake! At least
      none being sold by the slice. It turned out they were shorthanded that day and
      it&#39;d be a while before the cheesecake was ready. <br><br>We had to comfort
      ourselves with a Brooklyn Blackout cupcake (we got the regular size although
      they do mini cupcakes also) and a slice of sour cherry pie. <br><br>Wow. Just
      wow. The Brooklyn Blackout cupcake had a great crumb and was wonderfully tender
      with rich chocolate pudding inside. Perfectly balanced. <br>The sour cherry
      pie had great flaky pastry and a sweet and tart filling that I loved.<br><br>And
      just as we were getting up to leave, they brought out cheesecake by the slice.

      I wasn&#39;t available to finish because it was a lot. <br><br>Me and my sister
      ordered two plates for us and make a separate order for the kids at home. I
      used to don&#39;t understand why so many people stay on the line just to take
      a meal. It was my first time to spend a friday night that way. But it was a
      sort of fun expensive and I think I enjoyed it. <br><br>Next time, I would order
      a corn which I saw someone&#39;s table and took a lot of photos to keep the

      be great. I&#39;ve been to a lot of great places but I am also on the pit myself

      charcoal, good flavor, good cuts of meat, and tenderness.<br><br>I got the beef
      and pork ribs here. Sides were ok but that&#39;s not what judges this place.
      It&#39;s in the meat. Pork ribs were meh. Dry and not great. How are you gona
      be a bbq restaurant and not serve spareribs? A bbq competition will fail you
      right away. And the ribs sucked. Dry and no flavor or sweetness. TBH the sauce
      drowned everything out. A good rib can blow you away without sauce. A bad rib
      needs sauce to cover up the bad taste. <br><br>Beef ribs are the best here but
      dude, are you serious? No smoke or wood fire? No smoke ring? No smoky means
      no bbq. It was tender and tasted ok but this isn&#39;t meat loaf, it&#39;s BBQ
      beef ribs, and if you ain&#39;t got smoke, you&#39;re doing it wrong. <br><br>I&#39;ll

      here.  I definitely chose a perfect time because my wait was definitely less
      than 15mins.  <br>This place definitely lived up to its hype.  I give it a 5star
      in taste, quality, and service.  Ordered the beef ribs 5 pieces with a side
      of coleslaw and fries.  I think it was too much for one person.  The meat was
      soo tender, like it almost fell off the bone.  The meat itself was flavorful
      and the bbq sauce was delicious too, spicy and a bit sweet.  <br>  Definitely
      coming here again when I&#39;m in SD

      been cooked to perfection!  The line looked intimidating but it moved really
      fast!  <br><br>They say TX has the best BBQ but Phil&#39;s definitely has the
      better BBQ and is comparable to TX&#39;s Salt Lick BBQ!  If you&#39;re visiting

      rings<br><br>What I thought:<br>If I had to give a number 1 rating to a BBQ
      spot in California, Phil&#39;s would probably take the cake. I&#39;m a big BBQ
      fanatic so I&#39;ve had my fair share of BBQ joints in California. BBQ here
      doesn&#39;t compare to Texas, but Phil&#39;s is pretty damn good. Also decently
      priced ($21.99 for a full rack rib dinner).<br><br>I&#39;ve been here a couple
      times and thought it&#39;s finally time to drop a line. <br><br>I usually get
      the full rack of pork ribs. They&#39;re amazing. Meat is always fall off the
      bone and the pork quality is excellent. Always so fatty and juicy. Their BBQ
      sauce is great as well. Tangy and also a bit of spiciness to it. Portions are
      huge.<br><br>Their sides are good too. Fries always come out nice and crispy
      with a generous portion. Cole slaw is always adds a refreshing mix to the combo.<br><br>One
      of my favorite things to eat here are the onion rings! They&#39;re gigantic.
      I didn&#39;t even know they had onions this big. Always extremely crispy, good
      batter ratio, and seasoned perfectly. These are a must IMO. Get a large order
      to share with the table.<br><br>Lines here can get pretty crazy so try to come
      right when they open so you get to the front of the line. I&#39;ve been at the
      front, but also way in the back of the line. Put some time aside and enjoy a
      good meal!

      be a bbq restaurant and not serve spareribs? A bbq competition will fail you
      right away. And the ribs sucked. Dry and no flavor or sweetness. TBH the sauce
      drowned everything out. A good rib can blow you away without sauce. A bad rib
      needs sauce to cover up the bad taste. <br><br>Beef ribs are the best here but

    :body: It was my first time at Phil&#39;s and boy I had high expectations coming
      here.  I definitely chose a perfect time because my wait was definitely less
      than 15mins.  <br>This place definitely lived up to its hype.  I give it a 5star
      in taste, quality, and service.  Ordered the beef ribs 5 pieces with a side
      of coleslaw and fries.  I think it was too much for one person.  The meat was
      soo tender, like it almost fell off the bone.  The meat itself was flavorful
      and the bbq sauce was delicious too, spicy and a bit sweet.  <br>  Definitely
      coming here again when I&#39;m in SD

    :body: I have forgotten how delicious Phil&#39;s BBQ is!  My fall off the bone,
      BBQ sauce slathered ribs were so satisfying! The sauce was sweet but tangy and
      just delicious in my mouth!  The meat was super tender and you can tell it has
      been cooked to perfection!  The line looked intimidating but it moved really
      fast!  <br><br>They say TX has the best BBQ but Phil&#39;s definitely has the
      better BBQ and is comparable to TX&#39;s Salt Lick BBQ!  If you&#39;re visiting
      San Diego, this is a must try!  I wanted to eat it once more before I leave
      San Diego but didn&#39;t get a chance to!  I still crave Phil&#39;s BBQ and
      will have to plan another trip here just for this!

    :comment: Full rack of pork ribs
    :body: What I got:<br>Full rack pork rib dinner w/ fries and cole slaw<br>Onion
      rings<br><br>What I thought:<br>If I had to give a number 1 rating to a BBQ
      spot in California, Phil&#39;s would probably take the cake. I&#39;m a big BBQ
      fanatic so I&#39;ve had my fair share of BBQ joints in California. BBQ here
      doesn&#39;t compare to Texas, but Phil&#39;s is pretty damn good. Also decently
      priced ($21.99 for a full rack rib dinner).<br><br>I&#39;ve been here a couple
      times and thought it&#39;s finally time to drop a line. <br><br>I usually get
      the full rack of pork ribs. They&#39;re amazing. Meat is always fall off the
      bone and the pork quality is excellent. Always so fatty and juicy. Their BBQ
      sauce is great as well. Tangy and also a bit of spiciness to it. Portions are
      huge.<br><br>Their sides are good too. Fries always come out nice and crispy
      with a generous portion. Cole slaw is always adds a refreshing mix to the combo.<br><br>One
      of my favorite things to eat here are the onion rings! They&#39;re gigantic.
      I didn&#39;t even know they had onions this big. Always extremely crispy, good
      batter ratio, and seasoned perfectly. These are a must IMO. Get a large order
      to share with the table.<br><br>Lines here can get pretty crazy so try to come
      right when they open so you get to the front of the line. I&#39;ve been at the
      front, but also way in the back of the line. Put some time aside and enjoy a
      good meal!

      a reservation through the yelp app, but I&#39;m not too sure how reliable that
      was. When we got there, it seemed like a lot of other people got in before us,
      but maybe that&#39;s just because they had reservations, too. I ended up going
      up to the hostess stand to inquire about our yelp reservation and it seemed
      like she took down all my information for a second time. <br><br>We had just
      gotten off the plane after taking a red eye, so we were hungry anddd I was ready
      for a drink. I ordered a mimosa, which was made with fresh orange juice. It
      was an excellent start to my morning. <br><br>I have a bit of indecisiveness
      when it comes to ordering.... so obviously I got the pancake flight. I also
      got a side of bacon. I chose the peach pancake, the blueberry and the pineapple.
      I liked the peach one the best, but all three were excellent. I don&#39;t particularly
      like pancakes, I just got them for the toppings lol. The bacon was kinda mehhh
      I like my bacon crispy, but here they serve it in thick slices that were kinda
      droopy. I should have ordered them to be crispy. That was my bad. <br><br>Service

      I like my bacon crispy, but here they serve it in thick slices that were kinda

      loved the hippos the most. They even had various places to kick up your feet
      and get a cold drink because it was rather warm that day. About 75 degrees but
      the humidity was heavy compared to where I live in Las Vegas. With the humidity
      it made us sweat a little and we walked the whole zoo. <br><br>I think the best

  - :body: High quality zoo with love for its animals - but PANDAS AREN&#39;T HERE
      ANYMORE. This should be clear to visitors before even entering the park or paying
      $50+ for a ticket. I came here on my only day off only to feel super disappointed
      that there&#39;s no sign or indication that the panda conservation project ended.
      I had to Google it after asking where they were. There&#39;s merch, shops, and
      restaurants titled after pandas so one would assume..... the zoo has many other
      incredible animals for viewing, but I feel its purposely left out that you won&#39;t
      be seeing any pandas during your visit. Even our tour didn&#39;t mention it.<br><br>There
      are bus tours and a sky tram for free use, but other than that, the park isn&#39;t
      walking friendly at all. Almost all of it is uphill, and if you need to change
      directions, good luck. Paths are either downhill or uphill. The signs are confusing
      and lead in circles. The map doesn&#39;t help since all the paths cross and
      intertwine. Wheelchairs and strollers beware. I think the concept behind this
      zoo is wonderful, and their heart is in the right place.. but certain things
      are misleading. I&#39;m leaving sore and pretty sad.

  - :body: This is by far the best zoo I&#39;ve ever been to. The habitats are so
      carefully thought out to be the most comfortable and closest in feel to the
      natural homes of each animal. Nothing actually looks like a cage. I also enjoy
      the unique layout of the paths; it feels more like taking a slow meandering
      hike, which is a huge enhancement to the experience for me. You can walk the
      whole zoo in 10k steps or less, but you don&#39;t need to with the bus tour
      and tram ride included in the ticket. As can be expected, the prices of food
      border on extortion, but outside food is allowed in so pack a lunch and it&#39;s
      all good. We&#39;re SoCal locals, so if we plan to go to the zoo (or Safari
      Park) more than once throughout the year it&#39;s actually cheaper to get the
      passes, and makes it nice to have the freedom for spur-of-the-moment trips to
      SD with no added cost (thanks in part to the free parking).

  - :body: It was a good zoo visit and we enjoyed our time at the zoo! I&#39;ve been
      here before as a kid, but honestly, I don&#39;t remember much about the trip.
      We arrived around 10am and it wasn&#39;t too crowded despite the holiday weekend
      (Memorial). I recommend bringing your own lunch because the lunch options offered
      didn&#39;t look too appealing when I researched online. It was interesting seeing
      it all again as an adult now! The zoo is apparently one of the largest zoos
      in the world, that was an interesting fact that I did not know. <br><br>The
      zoo is home to a variety of different species from all around the world, and
      the staff were all friendly and great caretakers of the animals. The habitats
      all looked nice and re-created to the animals&#39; natural habitats. The park
      is huge, so be ready for plenty of walking. A nice feature is the Alaska Airline
      Skyfari Aerial Tram, which takes you from one side of the park to the other.
      We took it two times and it was an enjoyable ride that presented an overhead
      view of the zoo.<br><br>We left around 5pm and explored the majority of the
      zoo, so it takes a good chunk out of your day if you&#39;re planning to walk
      most of it. At the price of the ticket, you should definitely try to see as
      much of the zoo as you can. We enjoyed all the different sections of the zoo,
      each area had unique species that you didn&#39;t know existed. Overall, I enjoyed
      the visit to San Diego Zoo and would recommend coming.

  - :body: Growing up in the Bronx, I would visit the Bronx Zoo frequently as a child
      and teenager. That&#39;s really my point of reference when visiting other zoos,
      which can be a good and bad thing since the Bronx Zoo is arguably one of the
      greatest zoos in the country. Since I was in San Diego, I just *had* to visit
      the San Diego Zoo and see how it stacked up, so after a quick breakfast I headed
      over to check it out. <br><br>The Zoo was already winning points with me even
      before entering when I was happy to discover free parking. Is that a thing?
      Was it because I came on a weekday? Whatever the reason, free parking is always
      a plus. <br><br>After paying admission I grabbed a map to plan out my visit.
      They have a really good selection of animals mostly separated by geographic
      region. Navigating was fairly easy, though I found a lot of the exhibits kind
      of melded into one which I found a tad confusing. For example, you would start
      by looking to see one animal and then just end up seeing four more exhibits.
      I found it both a good and bad thing, because the continuity is great but at
      times also just wanted to stop and regroup. My favorite exhibits were probably
      the Elephant Odyssey and the polar bears. I really wanted to see the giant pandas
      but I was crushed to find out they were returned to China only a few months
      ago, *sigh*. <br><br>Some nice features were the shuttle that takes you around
      the zoo for about 35 minutes that also served as a mini-tour, as well as the
      Skyfari which takes you from one end of the zoo to the other. I was also really
      impressed by the state of the park as a whole - it was pretty well organized
      and had a real finished look.<br><br>Overall, I had a great day at the San Diego
      Zoo - this definitely calls for a return trip to the Bronx Zoo so that I can
      do a comparison in more real time. If you&#39;re in the SD area I totally recommend
      you check it out, take in some green, some sun, and of course some animals.

      They take great care of and do a lot for the animals, it seems, and it is so
      educational walking around to read, listen, watch, and see them all. <br>The
      Safari Park is bigger and is included in the yearly pass, but parking isn&#39;t
      included. Visit both and see for yourself.

    :body: This is by far the best zoo I&#39;ve ever been to. The habitats are so
      carefully thought out to be the most comfortable and closest in feel to the
      natural homes of each animal. Nothing actually looks like a cage. I also enjoy
      the unique layout of the paths; it feels more like taking a slow meandering
      hike, which is a huge enhancement to the experience for me. You can walk the
      whole zoo in 10k steps or less, but you don&#39;t need to with the bus tour
      and tram ride included in the ticket. As can be expected, the prices of food
      border on extortion, but outside food is allowed in so pack a lunch and it&#39;s
      all good. We&#39;re SoCal locals, so if we plan to go to the zoo (or Safari
      Park) more than once throughout the year it&#39;s actually cheaper to get the
      passes, and makes it nice to have the freedom for spur-of-the-moment trips to
      SD with no added cost (thanks in part to the free parking).

    :body: It was a good zoo visit and we enjoyed our time at the zoo! I&#39;ve been
      here before as a kid, but honestly, I don&#39;t remember much about the trip.
      We arrived around 10am and it wasn&#39;t too crowded despite the holiday weekend
      (Memorial). I recommend bringing your own lunch because the lunch options offered
      didn&#39;t look too appealing when I researched online. It was interesting seeing
      it all again as an adult now! The zoo is apparently one of the largest zoos
      in the world, that was an interesting fact that I did not know. <br><br>The

      is huge, so be ready for plenty of walking. A nice feature is the Alaska Airline
      Skyfari Aerial Tram, which takes you from one side of the park to the other.
      We took it two times and it was an enjoyable ride that presented an overhead
      view of the zoo.<br><br>We left around 5pm and explored the majority of the
      zoo, so it takes a good chunk out of your day if you&#39;re planning to walk
      most of it. At the price of the ticket, you should definitely try to see as
      much of the zoo as you can. We enjoyed all the different sections of the zoo,
      each area had unique species that you didn&#39;t know existed. Overall, I enjoyed

      They have a really good selection of animals mostly separated by geographic
      region. Navigating was fairly easy, though I found a lot of the exhibits kind
      of melded into one which I found a tad confusing. For example, you would start
      by looking to see one animal and then just end up seeing four more exhibits.
      I found it both a good and bad thing, because the continuity is great but at
      times also just wanted to stop and regroup. My favorite exhibits were probably
      the Elephant Odyssey and the polar bears. I really wanted to see the giant pandas

      flapjacks and waffles. There&#39;s really nowhere to go wrong on the menu, and
      yes the sage fried chicken and waffle tower is the jim jam, and yes you should

      The bar menu is easy to get lost in; our favorites include coffee, cranberry
      mimosas, and if you&#39;re into getting fancy: the smores mocha is absolutely

      big appetites only, y&#39;all.<br><br>Next, food: I was easily swayed toward
      ordering a ribs, mash, eggs, and biscuit special on the weekend brunch menu,
      because, well, ribs. My lovely wife ordered the Smoked Chicken Scramble which
      is made with spinach, sun dried tomato pesto, and goat cheese, also coming with
      a potato option.<br><br>The griddled mash side at Hash House is great, and usually
      our choice over the home fried style potatoes....however....sharing our favorite
      Hash House Hack with you now: sub out your potatoes for either a side salad
      (only available after lunch starts ~11am) or a side of fruit. You&#39;ll get
      plenty of carbs from the super light and flaky biscuits smothered with homemade
      jam waiting for you on the table already, so pass on the taters and have some
      more fruit or veggies...you might even surprise yourself and finish your meal;
      something that doesn&#39;t often happen at Hash House.<br><br>Hoping that Hash
      House lasts at least another 18 years for us to enjoy, and yes it&#39;s worth
      the wait, and get there before 9am to avoid the crowds.'

      big quantity. My boyfriend did tell me this before we came here, but once I
      saw the table next to us got their food... I was shook. The plates are like
      a boat size. I tried their famous fried chicken benedict &amp; OH MY GOD; it

      best way to describe the entire experience. Yesss the portions are HUGE and
      look GORGEOUS, but quantity doesn&#39;t always mean quality and in this instance
      it definitely does not! I ordered the brown sugar &amp; banana pancake. There
      was literally an entire banana inside the pancake.. not sliced into small enjoyable
      pieces, but rather a large banana sliced in half and a pancake baked around
      it. Also, highly disappointed by the lack of brown sugar! It was definitely
      disappointing, nothing more than a banana inside of a plain and semi-dry pancake.<br><br>Hubby
      ordered the chicken &amp; waffles. Presentation was on point and the waffles
      were stuffed with bacon, but both the waffles and the chicken were dry. The
      only thing worse than dry chicken is a dry waffle served without maple syrup.
      Sad to say, my hubby&#39;s meal had both.<br><br>Onto the service. Oye... what
      a nightmare our server was!! Our friend requested to speak to a manager about
      a special request that our server denied. He walked away and came back with
      what the manager supposedly said. If he did in fact speak to the manager on
      her behalf, shame on that manager!!!! Any establishment knows that the manager
      ALWAYS greets a table that requests to speak with them!!! During the course
      of our meal, we had to ask 3 servers other than ours, for items that we needed
      because our server was no where to be found. Simple things like napkins, drink
      refills and syrup because oddly enough the chicken &amp; waffles didn&#39;t
      come with syrup.<br><br>Overall, a highly disappointing experience. Large but
      expensive portions that are subpar, accompanied by poor service.

    :body: Alright... This place needs a warning sign. These meals are not built for
      humans.<br><br>We decided to try this place... drawn by the name and proximity...
      before heading out on the road. Looking for something light. Corned beef hash
      with eggs and fruit sounds like moderation, right? The price seemed high, but,
      well... we&#39;ve been doing that all vacation long.<br><br>We didn&#39;t see
      any meals delivered before we ordered or I may have done a change up. These
      meals are huge!!! Served in a 10-inch frying pan, edge to edge. Absolutely should
      be shared with another person. Be prepared.<br><br>The meals itself? Delicious.
      The corned beef hash was slices of hash laying on top of very large potato wedges,
      all cooked to perfection. The large fist-sized biscuits were also delicious,
      as was the locally prepared jam on the table. A sprig of rosemary made the presentation
      complete.<br><br>If I had any complaint it was the eggs... Which we&#39;re cooked
      great but cooled off way too quickly. Not sure if that was a function of the
      pan or the time it may have sat in the kitchen. <br><br>By the way, I prefer
      a dark-roast coffee but just ordered coffee. What I received was probably the
      best cup of restaurant coffee that I&#39;ve ever had. This place has got it
      going on.<br><br>Oh, and if you visit on a Sunday morning, get there before
      nine. We were seated immediately with indoor and outdoor options. When we left
      right around ten, there were probably 12-15 parties waiting.

    :body: Among the many brunch places I&#39;ve been to, this  place is definitely
      one of my favorites in San Diego. I go here every so often when my friends from
      out of town come to visit and I have yet to see someone who wasn&#39;t amazed
      by their food. The wait can go from 15min-1hr from my experience, it just depends
      on if you get caught in the brunch rush time! The food here is a little on the
      pricier side, but the portions of food are HUGE. I would recommend sharing a
      plate with someone if you are a light eater. I personally enjoy their alcoholic
      beverages they offer as well (I came here for brunch on my 21st birthday). Their
      mimosas are great and they have different choices of juice. <br><br>The service
      here is also great. Everyone is so kind and helpful. I was eating here once
      with my little brother and he found a hair in his food and they kindly gave
      him another plate and took it off the bill. I thought that was so kind of them
      and I really appreciate how they handled the situation. Thank you for a great
      experience and I will for sure be back!

    :body: 'We&#39;ve been having breakfast and brunch at Hash House for about 18
      years and it&#39;s consistently the best breakfast in San Diego, and honestly
      maybe anywhere ever at that.<br><br>This is perhaps one of the birthplaces of
      modern &#34;big cuisine,&#34; where the giant platter sized plates are teeming
      with delicious eggy scrambles, potato based hashes, and bigger than your head
      flapjacks and waffles. There&#39;s really nowhere to go wrong on the menu, and
      yes the sage fried chicken and waffle tower is the jim jam, and yes you should
      try it, and yes also probably share it with a friend.<br><br>First, drinks:
      The bar menu is easy to get lost in; our favorites include coffee, cranberry
      mimosas, and if you&#39;re into getting fancy: the smores mocha is absolutely
      decadent and the BLT Mary is a pre-meal BLT snack and cocktail all in one; for
      big appetites only, y&#39;all.<br><br>Next, food: I was easily swayed toward
      ordering a ribs, mash, eggs, and biscuit special on the weekend brunch menu,
      because, well, ribs. My lovely wife ordered the Smoked Chicken Scramble which
      is made with spinach, sun dried tomato pesto, and goat cheese, also coming with
      a potato option.<br><br>The griddled mash side at Hash House is great, and usually
      our choice over the home fried style potatoes....however....sharing our favorite

    :body: 'Service: service was great from start to finish. Drinks were served right
      away and our orders were taken at that time too. Food came in less than 10 min.<br><br>Food:
      The food was amazing! We saw the couple next to us eating chicken and waffles
      so my girlfriend and I searched the menu for them and found them at the bottom.
      We ordered the sage chicken and waffles and geez... I can see why there&#39;s
      all this talk about it. The two pieces of chicken were moist and very flavorful
      while the waffle with bacon in the middle (woah!?!) was very good. We shared
      just this one plate and still couldn&#39;t finish it.<br><br>Parking: parking
      is mostly metered parking and there&#39;s plenty of it. We came on a Friday
      morning around 815 am and there was plenty of open spots in front. <br><br>Overall:
      truly one of the best breakfasts in San Diego. Huge huge huge portions and priced
      very well! Try the coffee drinks! They&#39;re amazing.'

      and I&#39;ve yet to find a place in San Diego I enjoy more. <br><br>I usually
      order the veggie roll and the caterpillar roll, while my boyfriend usually goes
      for the sashimi<br><br>I&#39;ve never had a complaint about anything I&#39;ve
      ever eaten. The caterpillar roll is delicious. The fish almost melts in your
      mouth and ingredients are perfectly balanced. One thing that has always surprised
      me is that the veggie roll is surprisingly satisfying here. <br><br>This place
      is pricey so be warned. The quality is definitely there but expect the bill
      to get high quickly. Additionally sushi ota is super popular so make sure to
      call beforehand for a reservation. I&#39;ve never tried walk-in but given my
      experiences I would expect the wait to be pretty long if not impossible. <br><br>Consensus?

      I love sushi. I think for San Diego, sure this is good sushi but compared to
      the best high class fresh sushi restaurants in LA or even Japan this tastes
      like it comes from a gas station. I&#39;ve eaten here 3 times and the last time
      it felt me sick. Besides sushi, I&#39;ve also eaten teriyaki chicken, vegetable
      tempura, edamame made &#34;spicy&#34; (it was only Sriracha). They were edible
      but mediocre. The miso soup however is delicious!! <br>Back to the sushi, the
      last time I had it the tuna had a gray tent, probably old fresh. I definitely
      should not have eaten the other fish once I saw that. <br>I personally wouldn&#39;t
      come here for sushi but feel free to give it a try. The servers are great. I
      suggest parking in the back lot because the front is a mad house. I also suggest
      making reservations. I guess that&#39;s a good thing and means people in San
      Diego actually like this place. Good luck!

      one of my favorite foods. While at a conference in San Diego, my coworker decided
      on Sushi Ota for one of our dinners and I&#39;m SO glad he did. <br><br>We were
      able to make reservations on the same day. They only had reservation times at
      5:30 and 8:00 but that wasn&#39;t really a big deal. They open at 5:30 and we
      chose that reservation time. We chose to do the $120 omakase, which included
      sashimi, sushi and prepared dishes like salad and cooked foods. They asked us
      if we wanted to move to the sushi bar, which definitely added to the experience.
      <br><br>The food is super delicious. We started off with &#34;salad&#34;: cucumber
      salad and Choy sum with carrots and bonito. It was nicely presented and a refreshing
      start to the meal. We then had the sashimi course which had 4 types of fish
      and played very nicely. We had a cooked fish course, a fried fish course, a
      daikon with scallop in soup course, followed by several pieces of sushi and
      dessert. The chutoro, uni and salmon were my favorites. The marinated ahi and
      broiled white fish were also very good. We finished off our lovely dinner with
      strawberry ice cream and raspberries with cranberry jello. It was amazing.<br><br>I
      appreciated that the sushi chef considered our input. I love uni, while my coworker
      doesn&#39;t, so while I got uni, he got ikura. He was also very nice to talk
      to:  friendly, but just the right amount.<br><br>The service by the waitresses
      was fantastic. They cleared plates quickly, refilled our water and tea, and
      even changed out our shoyu dishes. <br><br>I&#39;ve had omakase for $250 per

    :comment: Half eaten Wagyy Rolls! The most amazing rolls ever.
    :body: 'We decided to try our Sushi Ota, due to many people recommending it as
      the &#34;best sushi place in San Diego.&#34; <br><br>Service: 5/5<br>I called
      on Saturday around 3pm for a reservation on that day! Surprisingly, I got a
      reservation for two at 9:00pm. I wish I remembered our waitress&#39;s name,
      but she was great! Very attentive and helped us out since it was our first time
      being there. <br><br>Food: <br>* Wagyu Rolls 5/5 ($25)<br>I loved the Wagyu
      Rolls! Pretty pricey for 8 peices but they were amazing! Best thing we had that
      night.<br><br>* Sashimi Sampler 3/5 ($45)<br>Consisted of Scallops, Spanish
      Mackerel, Lean Tuna, O Toro (fatty tuna), and salmon. I know I&#39;m missing
      one fish but I forgot and didn&#39;t take a picture!!! I would say the lean
      tuna was probably the best, but overall, everything was kind of meh. Not melt-in-your-mouth
      yummy like I expected. <br><br>* Sushi (2pcs). 3/5 <br>We got the O Toro ($15),
      Kinme Golden Eye ($14) , Eel Unagi ($6), and Eel Anago (4.50). Everything was
      just okay. The eel were definitely the best out of them all. The rest felt kind
      of chewy. <br><br>I&#39;d say this place was definitely a little too hyped up!
      I enjoyed the experience, but have gotten sushi for way less and better quality
      elsewhere. And I&#39;m a poor college student so it was disappointing to still
      be hungry after my meal :('

      restaurants but this one is my number one! Their fish are very fresh and soo
      delicious! I would say I found my new favorite sushi restaurant plus it&#39;s
      just few minutes walk from my place. One of my favorites are the belly sampler,
      jalapeño yellowtail, sashimi sampler and their mushroom salad. It&#39;s so tasty,
      mouth watering, indulging. It&#39;s definitely the best sushi/sashimi I&#39;ve
      ever had. Their rolls are very good too! I&#39;m inlove with sushi Ota! <br>The
      place is not too big, so I would suggest having reservations because they are
      always busy. Walk ins take atleast an hour and 45minutes of waiting! They&#39;re
      always busy but the foods are so worth it! The chefs are very professional and
      great chefs! If you want something special, you name it and they will served
      it in front of you. I would suggest requesting seating at the front where they
      make sushi&#39;s in front of you. It&#39;s fun eating your food and watching
      them making it right in front of you, it&#39;s not only they&#39;re preparing
      your foods but it&#39;s like watching an art, It&#39;s beautiful! A toast of

  - :body: I could&#39;ve spent our whole 5 day vaca trying to source through all
      of the hidden (and not so hidden) gems in Balboa Park! As a theatre and art
      lover, I simply *could NOT* with this park. Are you kidding me?! Studios upon
      studios of local artists?! An amphitheater dedicated to organ concerts?! THE
      OLD GLOBE?! Balboa Park, you need to chill.<br><br>We started our adventure
      by walking through the air and space museum store, and then I speed-peed in
      the world&#39;s sketchiest bathrooms. If you need to pee in Balboa Park, do
      NOT pee near the air and space museum. Go further into the park. You&#39;ve
      been WARNED! These museums in this are look a bit more run down than the rest
      of the park, but still worth exploring if you&#39;ve got the time.<br><br>THEN
      we made our way through the United Nations area. Everything was closed, but
      it was still awesome to go in the store and see some of the different offerings
      from each country. THEN we made our way to the visitors center so someone could
      explain how fitting all of this STUFF in one park was even legal. Super helpful,
      told us to go the free art building...so we did. THEN we went into the botanical
      building in the name of greenery and Instagram. THEN we went to the Spanish
      villa area and saw all of the local artists at work selling their *goods.*<br><br>We
      did a whole slew of other things then got really overwhelmed and had to leave.
      Overall, this is the most amazing &#34;park&#34; I&#39;ve ever been to and I
      barely scratched the service while I was there. A San Diego &#34;not to be missed&#34;

  - :body: We decided to go to Balboa Park and just play it by ear in terms of what
      we wanted to see. We parked in the first lot we found (free parking!) which
      was right next to the Organ Pavilion. We wandered into the park and headed right
      to the Visitor&#39;s center. We bought a small book while there that had a self
      guided walking tour map, so we decided to use that for the day. The book led
      us through several gardens (really loved the cactus garden, and I&#39;m sure
      the rose garden would be amazing when in full bloom!) and by several architecturally
      amazing buildings and fountains. We felt like we really hit the jackpot when
      we found the artist enclave! So many different artists with such a great variety
      of art! We spent a great deal of time in this area. As we continued our walking
      tour, we heard organ music so we headed back to the Organ Pavilion and discovered
      that a school field trip was there to learn more about the organ. So we sat
      in the audience and listened to their presenter speak about the history of the
      organ, and then he played a few pieces on it. To keep the kids&#39; interest,
      he even played a piece by Queen which sounded amazing! <br><br>At this point
      we were hungry, so we went to the Natural History Museum cafe for sandwiches.
      We got the ready made ones, which were fairly good, nothing special. Then we
      headed to the Timken Art museum which was small but really interesting. Saw
      a lot of unique buildings, gardens and fountains as we worked our way back to
      our car. We really enjoyed ourselves and were entertained all day without spending
      hardly any money - that was a big win!

      worry - the park administrators have got you covered! There is a free mobile

      near where you currently are in the park, popular attractions and so much more
      information. They even have a guide for destinations in the park if you&#39;re

      Garden, and Cactus Garden [see a theme here? ;)]. There are plenty of things
      to see and do in the park, but my husband and I didn&#39;t have nearly enough
      time to see them all in. While walking around we also saw signs for other events
      that happen in the park, like Food Truck Fridays. <br><br>As for parking, we
      parked in one of the off-site, free parking lots and took the free tram into
      the main area of the park. The tram runs every 8 minutes and then every 15 minutes
      after 5:00PM. It was quick and convenient and we didnt have to spend too much

  - :body: I&#39;ve racked my brains for awhile on what to write my 300th Yelp review
      on. This brings me back home to San Diego and where else than Balboa Park which
      I surprisingly have never reviewed? This entire area has a special place in
      my heart, even after being away from home for the last four years, so it&#39;s
      only appropriate that Balboa Park is my 300th review. <br><br>TL;DR:<br>- I
      always recommend Balboa Park to visiting friends!<br>- Natural History Museum
      is my favorite<br>- Balboa Park Free Tuesdays--free admission to select museums<br>-
      Spreckels Organ Pavilion<br>- Great place to stroll or jog<br>- Japanese Friendship
      Garden<br>- Museum of Man<br>- International Cottages--check out the House of
      the Philippines!<br>- Wedding engagement photoshoots<br>- December Nights--fun,
      but insanely crowded<br>- The Prado restaurant for that bougie date night<br>-
      Watch out for the upcoming San Diego Comic Con museum in the former San Diego
      Hall of Champions Sports Museum!<br><br>It&#39;s not that Balboa Park needs
      another five-star review, but I guess it won&#39;t hurt sharing my five-star
      experience, especially to my growing number of friends who are not from SD.
      In short, Balboa Park is considered the Central Park of the West Coast. The
      park is home to the world-famous San Diego Zoo. Balboa Park is also home to
      the 1915 Panama-California Exposition, hence the 2015 Balboa Park Centennial
      Celebration which I completely missed since I left San Diego the year prior.
      Another close equivalent to Balboa Park is Los Angeles&#39; Griffith Park, minus
      the observatory and Hollywood sign, plus the heart, soul, and culture. <br><br>My
      very first experience with Balboa Park was in the 2nd grade--a school field
      trip to the Natural History Museum. So unforgettable with dinosaur bone displays.
      The museum was easily my favorite on Balboa Park and still is!<br><br>Fast-forward
      to the week-long 5th grade field trip to Balboa Park. From Monday to Friday,
      us 5th graders visited various museums including the zoo, and the Reuben H.
      Fleet Science Center! The center is basically San Francisco&#39;s Exploratorium
      in a much smaller scale. The field trip was the time I first saw the Spreckels
      Organ Pavilion and instantly fell in love. Organ Pavilion is an extremely popular
      location for wedding engagement photoshoots. <br><br>Middle school was when
      our teachers would constantly bring us to Reuben H. Fleet. During this time,
      I was drawn to the famous fountain in front of &#34;The Fleet.&#34;<br><br>Once
      I earned my driver&#39;s license, friends and I would hang here whenever college
      classes were not in session...or when we ditched class...kidding. As an adult,
      Balboa Park easily became the prime location for dates, wedding receptions,
      small concerts, Instagram photoshoots, and to patronize Balboa Park Free Tuesdays
      for San Diego residents and active duty military families! My first experiences
      with December Nights, the Old Globe Theatre, and the International Cottages
      were during my adult years. The last time I visited San Diego about six months
      ago, I made sure to visit Balboa Park as it has been a year. I deliberately
      waited until nightfall to visit in order to shoot photos of the Old Globe Theatre,
      Cabrillo Tower, and the Organ Pavilion. <br><br>Whenever I have friends ask
      me where to go when visiting San Diego, I always say, &#34;Mexican food, the
      beaches, Del Mar Fair, and Balboa Park!&#34; Del Mar Fair, or the San Diego
      County Fair may just be my 301st Yelp review!<br><br>Writing this review has
      made me miss San Diego again. In the last five years, I would only to San Diego
      once or twice a year. I cannot wait for my next return visit in under a month.
      <br><br>You must visit Balboa Park! Locals and tourists alike love this place!

      with Spanish architecture that will take your breath away.  Tons of museums
      and Restaurants and a brilliant amphitheater with free concerts. <br><br>Highlights
      include the history museum and the Japanese gardens. Also very neat street performers!

  - :body: This really is the heart of San Diego. <br><br>I&#39;ll begin by saying
      that I love Balboa Park, it&#39;s stunning.  It feels like you&#39;re in a plaza
      in Spain, the architecture is so beautiful. <br><br>While we were there we went
      to the Museum of Man and The Natural History Museum.  Both were fantastic and
      I highly recommend them, but even if you don&#39;t go to a museum go to Balboa
      Park. <br><br>Go on a weekend, there are so many different things to do and
      see.  It&#39;s a cornucopia of people and things to see and do.  I also love
      the Spanish Village Art Center, so will you if you love arts and crafts.  It&#39;s
      a beautiful tiled plaza filled with bougainvillea surrounded by folksy art galleries.<br><br>I
      grew up in San Diego, so I am well acquainted with Balboa Park but it never
      gets old and it&#39;s never boring.  It is very large with so many things to
      do and see that an entire weeks vacation could be centered just around Balboa
      Park.  They even have a zoo... you may have heard of it, The San Diego Zoo -
      the most famous zoo in the world.  It&#39;s also in Balboa Park.

  - :body: This is one of my favorite places ever! I&#39;ve loved it ever since I
      started coming when I was a teenager. What a truly beautiful and enriching place!
      Despite all the times I&#39;ve been here, there is still more to explore and
      do. I can just walk around and soak in the beautiful architecture and gardens
      and nature. <br><br>My last visit I took my children. We enjoyed listening to
      someone play the beautiful grand organ, then walked the grounds, at lunch at
      The Prado, went to the Science Museum and Natural History Museum, enjoyed dancing
      and listening to steel drum music by the fountain and ran around popping bubbles
      from the &#34;bubble man&#34;. It was my first time going to the science museum
      and it was pretty cool, but I wasn&#39;t over the top impressed probably because
      I have been to some pretty impressive science museums around the country. We
      did really love the natural history museum though. <br><br>Such a great landmark!
      If you have not experienced Balboa Park, you must!

  - :body: This is one my most favorite parks I have ever been to! The rose garden,
      the walking trails, the architecture of all the amazing buildings. It&#39;s
      fascinating! We went on a Saturday and were mesmerized by all the beauty around
      us. They have a bunch of people who set up to sell snacks and cold treats. In
      addition, they have a little place to dine on site as well! We really enjoyed
      this park and will definitely be back :) We didn&#39;t park here so I can&#39;t
      tell you about the parking situation. Also they have some musicians set up sporadically
      through out the park who were awesome! Just make sure you carry small bills
      so can tip them :)

      of the hidden (and not so hidden) gems in Balboa Park! As a theatre and art
      lover, I simply *could NOT* with this park. Are you kidding me?! Studios upon
      studios of local artists?! An amphitheater dedicated to organ concerts?! THE
      OLD GLOBE?! Balboa Park, you need to chill.<br><br>We started our adventure
      by walking through the air and space museum store, and then I speed-peed in
      the world&#39;s sketchiest bathrooms. If you need to pee in Balboa Park, do
      NOT pee near the air and space museum. Go further into the park. You&#39;ve
      been WARNED! These museums in this are look a bit more run down than the rest
      of the park, but still worth exploring if you&#39;ve got the time.<br><br>THEN
      we made our way through the United Nations area. Everything was closed, but
      it was still awesome to go in the store and see some of the different offerings
      from each country. THEN we made our way to the visitors center so someone could
      explain how fitting all of this STUFF in one park was even legal. Super helpful,
      told us to go the free art building...so we did. THEN we went into the botanical
      building in the name of greenery and Instagram. THEN we went to the Spanish
      villa area and saw all of the local artists at work selling their *goods.*<br><br>We
      did a whole slew of other things then got really overwhelmed and had to leave.
      Overall, this is the most amazing &#34;park&#34; I&#39;ve ever been to and I
      barely scratched the service while I was there. A San Diego &#34;not to be missed&#34;

      the 1915 Panama-California Exposition, hence the 2015 Balboa Park Centennial
      Celebration which I completely missed since I left San Diego the year prior.

      very first experience with Balboa Park was in the 2nd grade--a school field

      I surprisingly have never reviewed? This entire area has a special place in
      my heart, even after being away from home for the last four years, so it&#39;s
      only appropriate that Balboa Park is my 300th review. <br><br>TL;DR:<br>- I
      always recommend Balboa Park to visiting friends!<br>- Natural History Museum
      is my favorite<br>- Balboa Park Free Tuesdays--free admission to select museums<br>-
      Spreckels Organ Pavilion<br>- Great place to stroll or jog<br>- Japanese Friendship
      Garden<br>- Museum of Man<br>- International Cottages--check out the House of
      the Philippines!<br>- Wedding engagement photoshoots<br>- December Nights--fun,
      but insanely crowded<br>- The Prado restaurant for that bougie date night<br>-
      Watch out for the upcoming San Diego Comic Con museum in the former San Diego
      Hall of Champions Sports Museum!<br><br>It&#39;s not that Balboa Park needs
      another five-star review, but I guess it won&#39;t hurt sharing my five-star
      experience, especially to my growing number of friends who are not from SD.
      In short, Balboa Park is considered the Central Park of the West Coast. The
      park is home to the world-famous San Diego Zoo. Balboa Park is also home to
      the 1915 Panama-California Exposition, hence the 2015 Balboa Park Centennial
      Celebration which I completely missed since I left San Diego the year prior.
      Another close equivalent to Balboa Park is Los Angeles&#39; Griffith Park, minus
      the observatory and Hollywood sign, plus the heart, soul, and culture. <br><br>My
      very first experience with Balboa Park was in the 2nd grade--a school field
      trip to the Natural History Museum. So unforgettable with dinosaur bone displays.
      The museum was easily my favorite on Balboa Park and still is!<br><br>Fast-forward
      to the week-long 5th grade field trip to Balboa Park. From Monday to Friday,
      us 5th graders visited various museums including the zoo, and the Reuben H.
      Fleet Science Center! The center is basically San Francisco&#39;s Exploratorium
      in a much smaller scale. The field trip was the time I first saw the Spreckels
      Organ Pavilion and instantly fell in love. Organ Pavilion is an extremely popular
      location for wedding engagement photoshoots. <br><br>Middle school was when
      our teachers would constantly bring us to Reuben H. Fleet. During this time,
      I was drawn to the famous fountain in front of &#34;The Fleet.&#34;<br><br>Once
      I earned my driver&#39;s license, friends and I would hang here whenever college
      classes were not in session...or when we ditched class...kidding. As an adult,
      Balboa Park easily became the prime location for dates, wedding receptions,
      small concerts, Instagram photoshoots, and to patronize Balboa Park Free Tuesdays
      for San Diego residents and active duty military families! My first experiences
      with December Nights, the Old Globe Theatre, and the International Cottages
      were during my adult years. The last time I visited San Diego about six months
      ago, I made sure to visit Balboa Park as it has been a year. I deliberately
      waited until nightfall to visit in order to shoot photos of the Old Globe Theatre,
      Cabrillo Tower, and the Organ Pavilion. <br><br>Whenever I have friends ask
      me where to go when visiting San Diego, I always say, &#34;Mexican food, the
      beaches, Del Mar Fair, and Balboa Park!&#34; Del Mar Fair, or the San Diego
      County Fair may just be my 301st Yelp review!<br><br>Writing this review has
      made me miss San Diego again. In the last five years, I would only to San Diego
      once or twice a year. I cannot wait for my next return visit in under a month.
      <br><br>You must visit Balboa Park! Locals and tourists alike love this place!

  - :body: This is my absolute favorite dessert spot in SoCal! Just thinking about
      it... I think this is my favorite patisserie/restaurant ever!! No joke... and
      I&#39;ve been to a fair share.<br><br>My sinful relationship with Extraordinary
      started one day back in my college days and my cousin brought home some cake
      and pastries with fresh flowers and petals on them. After that first bite, inwas
      hooked. Once I found out they were in San Diego, I made sure that anytime I
      was there in DTSD, i would hit up either the original or Little Italy location.
      So for about 10+ years, my tradition for my trips to San Diego is to stop by
      Extraordinary Desserts.<br><br>My usual go-to cakes are the Black Velvet or
      Shangri-La or Banana Cream Pie. Ideally I want to try them ALL!! Luckily this
      time I went there was a brand-spankin&#39; new one that I have never seen or
      knew they made. It was the Matcha Misu. <br><br>This Matcha Misu was perfect.
      It was over the top sugary. The cake part was moist. Of course I love their
      cream. EOD makes the best butter cream and whipped cream!! If the world were
      to end tonight, I would spend it eating a tub full of their homemade whipped
      cream.<br><br>And actually, this one time I was in town and on my keto diet.
      It was a tradition, so I had to get dessert. I just ordered a bowl of fresh
      berries with a dollop of their homemade whipped cream. It is soooooooo goooooood!!!
      Yum!<br><br>Anyway, back to their Matcha Misu. The mango sauce that was paired
      with it added sweetness and a tarte flavor. Personally I liked the cake without
      the mango sauce. The edge of the cake was sprinkled with shaved white chocolate.
      Mmhmm... it was delectable. <br><br>For my main course (for lunch) was the Grilled
      Cheese and Mushroom. Oh... my... gods... if you love cheese and mushrooms, then
      this is for you!! Minus the fact the bread was a very thick slice, the cheese
      was gooey and delicious. The sauteed mushrooms had a balsamic vinegar reduction.
      <br><br>Can&#39;t wait to go back and have a meal and dessert. People do not
      realize EOD serves actual food. I definitely recommend wining, dining, and desserting
      there!

      Chocolate desserts are decadent. I recommend 10 people sharing 1 slice of chocolate
      cake. It&#39;s too rich and dense even if you split a slice of cake for 3 people.
      <br>We had the Shanghai-la and that was one of their lighter desserts. It has
      the right amount of sweetness. Tiramisu is my favorite but they never have it
      anymore.

  - :body: I&#39;ve been here several times now and I have to say I was a bit disappointed
      this time around. There was a lack of variety in desserts, and the cakes actually
      look better in the photos. :(  so sad! <br><br>This time I tried the Vegan Carrot
      Cake $12.75 and the Blueberry Coffee Cake $10. Both were very delicious! The
      vegan carrot cake is made with almond flour and it wasn&#39;t that noticeable
      because I almost forgot about it being vegan until towards the end when I was
      about to finish my slice I tried to see if I could taste a difference. Yes the
      vegan carrot cake is not as heavy nor rich like the carrot cake you might be
      used to. I enjoyed each bite and also felt less guilty afterwards :) <br><br>The
      coffee cake was also surprisingly not as heavy as some. For a good sized square
      piece, I was quite content afterwards and it satisfied my sweet tooth. <br><br>Paying
      over $22 for 2 desserts, I wouldn&#39;t say it was worth our money. <br><br>*20
      cents for a bag if you did not dine at the restaurant. *sigh*

      for a gluttonous experience. <br><br>My faves are the chocolate shortbread,
      and the famous chocolate croissant bread pudding. The matcha chocolate chip
      cookies were good too, but you only taste the matcha in the beginning before
      it&#39;s overpowered by those rich chocolatey chips.

  - :body: I haven&#39;t been in a few years so my friend &amp; I were downtown having
      dinner. We decided to stop in for dessert &amp; hot tea. She hadn&#39;t been
      to this location. It was a late Monday night &amp; only a 10 minute wait. We
      both had decided on our desserts I ordered the totamisu their take on tiramisu.
      I was very pleased with it. I ordered a chocolate bundt cake &amp; coconut cream
      cake to go. My friend had a ricotta cake. We then shared a delicious herbal
      tea as well. Our waitress was amazing. She took excellent care of us bringing
      us more hot water for our tea &amp; never rushing us even though they were about
      to close. As mentioned desserts do cost about $10.50, but that&#39;s what you
      come for. The service we received was excellent. I wish I had gotten her name.
      I will say it does get loud inside because there is nothing to absorb the sound.
      But I highly recommend this spot for desserts &amp; hot drinks.

      I&#39;ve been to a fair share.<br><br>My sinful relationship with Extraordinary
      started one day back in my college days and my cousin brought home some cake
      and pastries with fresh flowers and petals on them. After that first bite, inwas
      hooked. Once I found out they were in San Diego, I made sure that anytime I
      was there in DTSD, i would hit up either the original or Little Italy location.
      So for about 10+ years, my tradition for my trips to San Diego is to stop by
      Extraordinary Desserts.<br><br>My usual go-to cakes are the Black Velvet or
      Shangri-La or Banana Cream Pie. Ideally I want to try them ALL!! Luckily this
      time I went there was a brand-spankin&#39; new one that I have never seen or
      knew they made. It was the Matcha Misu. <br><br>This Matcha Misu was perfect.
      It was over the top sugary. The cake part was moist. Of course I love their
      cream. EOD makes the best butter cream and whipped cream!! If the world were
      to end tonight, I would spend it eating a tub full of their homemade whipped
      cream.<br><br>And actually, this one time I was in town and on my keto diet.
      It was a tradition, so I had to get dessert. I just ordered a bowl of fresh
      berries with a dollop of their homemade whipped cream. It is soooooooo goooooood!!!
      Yum!<br><br>Anyway, back to their Matcha Misu. The mango sauce that was paired
      with it added sweetness and a tarte flavor. Personally I liked the cake without
      the mango sauce. The edge of the cake was sprinkled with shaved white chocolate.
      Mmhmm... it was delectable. <br><br>For my main course (for lunch) was the Grilled
      Cheese and Mushroom. Oh... my... gods... if you love cheese and mushrooms, then
      this is for you!! Minus the fact the bread was a very thick slice, the cheese
      was gooey and delicious. The sauteed mushrooms had a balsamic vinegar reduction.
      <br><br>Can&#39;t wait to go back and have a meal and dessert. People do not
      realize EOD serves actual food. I definitely recommend wining, dining, and desserting

      Chocolate desserts are decadent. I recommend 10 people sharing 1 slice of chocolate

      <br>We had the Shanghai-la and that was one of their lighter desserts. It has

    :body: I haven&#39;t been in a few years so my friend &amp; I were downtown having
      dinner. We decided to stop in for dessert &amp; hot tea. She hadn&#39;t been
      to this location. It was a late Monday night &amp; only a 10 minute wait. We
      both had decided on our desserts I ordered the totamisu their take on tiramisu.
      I was very pleased with it. I ordered a chocolate bundt cake &amp; coconut cream
      cake to go. My friend had a ricotta cake. We then shared a delicious herbal
      tea as well. Our waitress was amazing. She took excellent care of us bringing
      us more hot water for our tea &amp; never rushing us even though they were about
      to close. As mentioned desserts do cost about $10.50, but that&#39;s what you
      come for. The service we received was excellent. I wish I had gotten her name.
      I will say it does get loud inside because there is nothing to absorb the sound.
      But I highly recommend this spot for desserts &amp; hot drinks.

  - :body: I&#39;ve heard nothing but amazing things about this famous BBQ joint in
      Dallas! Naturally, when I flew into Dallas for a quick weekend trip with friends,
      this was number one on our list of &#34;must eats.&#34; Pecan Lodge opens at
      11:00 a.m., so the line was already forming by the time we arrived at 10:30
      a.m. I highly suggest that folks arrive as early as possible. When the restaurant
      opened, there was an amusement park vibe about the announcements and rules,
      and you&#39;re led through a queue with metal bars. There&#39;s all sorts of
      Dallas memorabilia hanging on the walls, and the seating is ONLY available once
      the meal has been paid for and you have the receipt. Once you reach the cash
      register, there are souvenir items for sale, and a large chalkboard menu. Our
      friend ordered us fatty brisket, beef ribs, burnt ends, fried okra, collard
      greens, cole slaw, and macaroni and cheese. <br><br>We feasted like kings and
      queens that morning! The fatty brisket melts in your mouth with that gelatinous
      and meaty texture that you just don&#39;t find at other places. The beef ribs
      were fall off the bone, and the burnt ends were fatty and tender. Personally,
      I don&#39;t enjoy BBQ that is doused in sauce, so Texas BBQ is right up my alley.
      Out of all the sides, the macaroni and cheese was my favorite - creamy and delicious.
      The group was asked what their favorite meat dish was, and each person had a
      different answer. Personally, the brisket was my favorite, and I just don&#39;t
      think I&#39;ll be able to find this quality back in Philly. Amazing spot!

      to keep you cool, especially in this Texas heat. Once you get up to the door
      though you see the light at the end of the tunnel, one thing to note to management
      though, you would get alot more customers through the line if you didn&#39;t
      have only one cashier to process orders for customers.<br><br>Other than that
      the food here is pretty good, the brisket is nice and juicy, the sausage had
      great flavor. But the best thing that they have is the beef rib, the amount
      of flavor in that is amazing.

      was already a line! I was able to get seated and have my food within the first
      30 min of opening.<br><br>I opted for the sausage, brisket, and mac and cheese.

      line by going to the express line inside! As long as you order at least 5 lbs
      of bbq you can go to the short line.<br><br>I came here with a group of 5 hungry
      friends, and we decided to try their &#34;Trough&#34; which included a lb of
      brisket, lb of pork ribs, lb of pulled pork, 3 full sausage links, and 1 giant
      beef rib. We also decided to add another lb of moist brisket, a quart of mac
      n cheese, and a quart of fried okra. The bbq automatically comes with a side
      of pickles and onions as well. THIS WAS A TON OF FOOD!<br><br>You help yourself
      to napkins, utensils, drinks, etc and just get to the good eating. With juice
      running down your elbows, you know this is high quality bbq. I HIGHLY recommend

      Lodge was the very first place I made a stop at when I got to Dallas. While
      the line is long, it does move fairly quickly. We got there around 1PM on a
      Saturday and probably waited 35-40 minutes in line. <br><br>Pecan Lodge filled
      a craving I had that I didn&#39;t even know was there to begin with. My friend
      and I split a 3 meat combo with brisket, pork rib, and a jalapeño sausage along
      with Mac and cheese and dinner rolls. The meat was incredibly tender and melted
      in my mouth. It had that nice smoky flavor that you&#39;d expect from Texas
      BBQ. My favorite was definitely the pork rib - it was soooo flavorful. Aside
      from the meat, I was surprised by how good their dinner rolls were. I didn&#39;t
      expect much from it but the rolls were soft and airy. The 3 meat combo initially
      doesn&#39;t seem like much but it ended up being enough to fill up my friend
      and I so I would recommend splitting it unless you&#39;re super hungry. Looking
      forward to come back to Pecan Lodge the next time I&#39;m in the Dallas area!

  - :body: I was apprehensive on the hype of Pecan Lodge after having tried another
      BBQ establishment in Dallas and having it be mediocre. However, upon my first
      bite of Pecan Lodge&#39;s BBQ, I was completely hooked. This was what Texas
      BBQ should be. This was what everyone kept raving about and now I join that
      number. My husband and I arrived there at 10:30am. There was already a line
      going out the door, but as we got in line, the line grew exponentially more.
      <br><br>If you have a small group, getting there at 10:30am was ok. We grabbed
      a table after waiting about an hour in line, and there were 3 other tables for
      a party of 4 available. If you have a bigger group of at least 5 or more, I
      would get here way earlier because there aren&#39;t many of those tables. I
      didn&#39;t get a chance to see outside seating, so no idea how much is available
      out there. <br><br>Onto the food... we ordered a variety of things since my
      husband was visiting that weekend and I didn&#39;t know when I&#39;d be back
      to experience Pecan Lodge. We got four rolls, peach cobbler, burnt ends, brisket,
      and pork ribs. Everything I put into my mouth was a bite from heaven. The flavor
      was immediately so smoky and had so much depth. It was salty, smoky, buttery.
      They definitely rendered the fat so well because it melted right in your mouth
      and gave that buttery flavor to the meat. After every bite, we kept looking
      at each other with surprise because although we had high expectations, it was
      beyond what we thought could&#39;ve been done to BBQ meat. <br><br>If you&#39;re
      in the Dallas area, I would definitely not leave before trying this place. It
      has made a memorable impression on me and I can&#39;t wait to go back again.

  - :body: Some of the best BBQ I&#39;ve had here in Dallas. When you get to the restaurant
      be prepared to wait inside or even outside in a long line of other people waiting
      for some delicious food. If you&#39;re lucky you can grab a spot at the bar
      where they offer some greet beer, cider, and wine. The menu offers your basics
      like ribs, brisket, pulled pork, sausage, and more. The ribs were super tender.
      Although great without it, there is also delicious tomato and vinegar based
      BBQ sauces. The sides are great too! My favorite is the Mac and cheese with
      the bacon on top. They also offer the Hot Mess which is more delicious than
      it sounds! With the Hot Mess you get a HUGE sweet potato filled high with barbacoa,
      chipotle cream, cheese, butter, and green onions. <br><br>Highly suggest getting
      here early, especially on the weekends because the line does get long and they
      do  close when they sell out (and they do sell out!). However, the staff does
      a great job getting out the orders fast and accurately.

    :body: Wow this place is busy. <br>I would definitely come with a larger group
      and head for the 5 lb or greater line (which is inside) otherwise you could
      be waiting a long time. <br>The highlights for me were the ribs and brisket.
      My favorite side is the Mac and cheese as well as the fried okra. <br>But everything
      was hearty and delicious. <br>I wish we had a place like this by me!

      BBQ should be. This was what everyone kept raving about and now I join that

      a party of 4 available. If you have a bigger group of at least 5 or more, I
      would get here way earlier because there aren&#39;t many of those tables. I
      didn&#39;t get a chance to see outside seating, so no idea how much is available
      out there. <br><br>Onto the food... we ordered a variety of things since my

      and pork ribs. Everything I put into my mouth was a bite from heaven. The flavor
      was immediately so smoky and had so much depth. It was salty, smoky, buttery.
      They definitely rendered the fat so well because it melted right in your mouth
      and gave that buttery flavor to the meat. After every bite, we kept looking

    :body: Some of the best BBQ I&#39;ve had here in Dallas. When you get to the restaurant
      be prepared to wait inside or even outside in a long line of other people waiting
      for some delicious food. If you&#39;re lucky you can grab a spot at the bar
      where they offer some greet beer, cider, and wine. The menu offers your basics
      like ribs, brisket, pulled pork, sausage, and more. The ribs were super tender.
      Although great without it, there is also delicious tomato and vinegar based
      BBQ sauces. The sides are great too! My favorite is the Mac and cheese with
      the bacon on top. They also offer the Hot Mess which is more delicious than
      it sounds! With the Hot Mess you get a HUGE sweet potato filled high with barbacoa,
      chipotle cream, cheese, butter, and green onions. <br><br>Highly suggest getting
      here early, especially on the weekends because the line does get long and they
      do  close when they sell out (and they do sell out!). However, the staff does
      a great job getting out the orders fast and accurately.

      <br><br>My food was really good and unique (pay attention to the chef specialities!)
      and I found their staff to be wonderful. <br><br>At one point, I overheard the

      an elevated Latin American cuisine on par with the restaurant&#39;s niche. I
      ordered the cochinita and a margarita, and halfway through my meal I encountered
      a large piece of plastic wrap in my meal. This cemented my opinion that the
      dish was pre-cooked, pre-plated and warmed to order. <br><br>I notified the

  - :body: This is definitely not Tex-Mex. They do not have flour tortillas or butter
      and you have to ask for the salt. This is much closer to dishes from the southern
      region of Mexico and Mexico City. <br><br>I think it&#39;s really strange how
      many good reviews are here. I went here for my birthday dinner and was extremely
      underwhelmed by the food and service. We arrived an hour before closing time
      and about 30min prior to closing they started flashing the lights and picked
      up our table condiments. It was not super busy but there were some people there
      and our waiter would not get us water even after asking for more water... he
      just wasn&#39;t very attentive or friendly at all. <br><br>Our food came out
      surprisingly fast, I suspect it was already prepared and just kept in a warmer.
      I ordered the Poblano (chicken enchiladas with mole) and it was just ok. I wouldn&#39;t
      pay that much for it if I knew that&#39;s what I was getting. Everyone at the
      table was disappointed with their various meals but we were all trying to be
      positive and just enjoy our time together. <br><br>We also got a mixed drink-
      the Hibiscus and it was not mixed very well for a drink priced at $12. It was
      mainly alcohol and not very much flavor.<br><br>The waiter tried to take our
      plates before we were finished and when we were done he told us we needed to
      hurry up and order dessert if we are going to get any because the kitchen is
      closing (he told us this at exactly 10:00, the time they close). <br><br>We
      got a blueberry cake thing with ice cream on top and it wasn&#39;t great. It
      wasn&#39;t bad it just wasn&#39;t very good. <br>They rushed us out and as we
      were leaving the staff started smoking in the parking lot upwind of us. <br>The
      nice thing about this place is that there is parking and you could take a decent
      sized group here and everyone would get their food quickly (but not water refills)
      so I give it two stars. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t come back here. The price of
      the food does not reflect the quality of the food and service.

      about this place worked for me. Interesting the this place is 1 of 3 Mexican
      restaurants right next to each other. Almost went to La Ventana, but stayed
      the course and did not. <br><br>Decor-I really liked the outside. It looks like

      dining area. Also, has our door seating. <br><br>Service-Good. Waiter and manager

      were doing great often. I will say hostess didn&#39;t seem very happy to be
      there, would it kill her to smile?? <br><br>Food-Great! Starting with chips
      and salsa to salad to main dish, it was all great. Salsa had a smoky/fire roasted
      taste the went perfectly with crispy chips. House salad had awesome avocado
      dressing that freshened taste buds and prepared mouth for main dish. Chile relleno

      were quite critical I considered cancelling.  But knowing that every restaurant
      has its hits and misses and some reviewers are prone to hyper-criticism we decided
      to give it a try as the menu looked so amazingly interesting.  Are we freaking
      geniuses or what?  <br><br>For starters it was immediately apparent that we
      had a remarkable server.  We had a good idea of what we wanted to try and after
      offering a couple suggestions of his own, one of which was the entree we had
      our eye on, he confirmed that we had chosen well.  <br><br>One problem with
      dining at 11:00 is that food often comes out way too quickly.  I was prepared
      to ask him to request that the kitchen hold the prep of our entree until we
      were ready for it.  But I did not have to as he asked for our selections, and
      then gave our orders to the kitchen item by item as we selected and enjoyed
      each one.  Superb!  <br><br>We started with a house wine for the Secretary of
      the Interior and a top shelf Margherita for myownself. The top shelf Marg here
      is very nice.  Recommend.   <br><br>I should mention that the salsa here, served
      with thin crispy, salted chips is terrific.  Dark, complex and spicy it is prepared
      with we think a smoked chile which I am guessing is chipotle. It begs for chip
      after chip.<br><br>We began with the Ceviche Mixta.  Excelente! As good as we
      have ever enjoyed here in the states or in Peru, Costa Rica or Guatemala; served
      over shredded lettuce with chunks of ripe avacodo.  Very, very nice.<br><br>As
      I had recently cooked a Pozole Verde (ahem, using pozole that I made from scratch
      using Anson Mills dried Henry Moore Yellow Hominy Corn) I was thrilled to see
      it on a restaurant menu and eager to try a seasoned Mexican cook&#39;s recipe.
       It was absolutely wonderful.  And I can&#39;t say fer sure but it appeared
      to us that the lemon juice had been added just before serving as it tasted so
      fresh.  When the cup of soup was presented, my wife said, &#34;Oh, we just wanted
      to try a cup.&#34; To which the kitchen runner replied, &#34;That is a cup.&#34;.
       We cannot imagine how large the bowl portion is!<br><br>We explained to our
      server that being oldsters we most frequently share an entree as we do the appetizers.
       He said, &#34;I will prepare it for you on two plates.&#34; We ordered the
      Carne Asada.  The steak (skirt, I think) was nicely grilled and wonderfully
      flavorful.  It is served with a tasty homemade sweet corn tomal and a tostada
      topped with black bean puree, cheese, and a creamy serrano salsa.  Each item
      was halved so that each plate was served with a portion of each item, garnished
      with arugula.  This is how a patron oriented restaurant does it. A+<br><br>We
      could not have been more pleased.  A lovely dining experience.  As far as we&#39;re
      concerned, these cats knocked it out of the ball park.

  - :body: My friend and I decided to try this very popular restaurant, and I was
      not disappointed! I had flank steak. It was tender as a mother&#39;s love. The
      white queso &amp; fresh guacamole with chips and salsa where devine. Have little
      of each on a chip. All the flavors where excellent. I had a pineapple &amp;
      habenaro margarita the was so darn smooth, that i felt so relaxes and happy.
      My waiter (i can&#39;t remember his name), and managers Moises &amp; Mario where
      kind, and very professional. Well versed in the flavors of dishes &amp; drinks.
      Moises &amp; Mario went to wcwr rable to check on his customers! Kudos to the

    :body: This is definitely not Tex-Mex. They do not have flour tortillas or butter
      and you have to ask for the salt. This is much closer to dishes from the southern
      region of Mexico and Mexico City. <br><br>I think it&#39;s really strange how
      many good reviews are here. I went here for my birthday dinner and was extremely
      underwhelmed by the food and service. We arrived an hour before closing time
      and about 30min prior to closing they started flashing the lights and picked
      up our table condiments. It was not super busy but there were some people there
      and our waiter would not get us water even after asking for more water... he
      just wasn&#39;t very attentive or friendly at all. <br><br>Our food came out
      surprisingly fast, I suspect it was already prepared and just kept in a warmer.
      I ordered the Poblano (chicken enchiladas with mole) and it was just ok. I wouldn&#39;t
      pay that much for it if I knew that&#39;s what I was getting. Everyone at the
      table was disappointed with their various meals but we were all trying to be
      positive and just enjoy our time together. <br><br>We also got a mixed drink-
      the Hibiscus and it was not mixed very well for a drink priced at $12. It was
      mainly alcohol and not very much flavor.<br><br>The waiter tried to take our
      plates before we were finished and when we were done he told us we needed to
      hurry up and order dessert if we are going to get any because the kitchen is
      closing (he told us this at exactly 10:00, the time they close). <br><br>We
      got a blueberry cake thing with ice cream on top and it wasn&#39;t great. It
      wasn&#39;t bad it just wasn&#39;t very good. <br>They rushed us out and as we
      were leaving the staff started smoking in the parking lot upwind of us. <br>The
      nice thing about this place is that there is parking and you could take a decent
      sized group here and everyone would get their food quickly (but not water refills)
      so I give it two stars. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t come back here. The price of
      the food does not reflect the quality of the food and service.

      but we loved it. It was great to see the guys at work. <br><br>The atmosphere
      here is on point. It&#39;s sleek and sophisticated without feeling stuffy and
      unwelcoming. I saw all sorts of people and families enjoying a meal here! <br><br>The
      sushi itself is amazing. We mostly ate nigiri and each bite was more fantastic
      than the rest. The size, flavor, and texture of each piece was perfect. We had
      tuna, salmon, urchin, eel, rib, and many others. Each bite was easy to eat in
      one go and they put the perfect amount of sauce (soy or others) on for you,
      making eating and tasting the main focus. <br><br>My least favorite parts of
      the meal were the hot dishes like the fried chicken. It tasted to me over cooked
      and over seasoned, but the sushi was the main focus so it was easy to overlook.<br><br>We
      ended with the milky dessert and it did not fail to please either, but looking

      on a business trip for dinner. Wound up sharing with 2 other coworkers as we
      worked through enough sushi to satisfy with yellowtail, salmon, fatty salmon,
      spicy tuna roll, salmon roll, and an amazing ice cream and doughnut dessert.
      Every bit of it was truly world class. Perhaps more impressively, a table of
      8 of us got out for about $45/person, which is way cheaper than I was expecting.<br><br>Definitely
      come here. It&#39;s worth the hype. A bunch of San Francisco and Washington,

      thing.

      you had unlimited funds to eat like this ALL the damn time. I&#39;ve been wanting
      to try Uchi since I first visited ATX almost 10 years ago and I was so excited
      to learn that HTX had a location as well. It was meant to be! <br><br>We arrived
      on a Sunday evening around 7pm with no reservations. They quoted us a 45min
      - 1 hour wait but we ended up only waiting about 20 minutes or so. So, I highly
      recommend reservations unless you want to wait! <br><br>Right as we sat down,
      our server asked if we had been here before. As we all said &#34;No,&#34; she
      promptly went into expectation setting. She said yes, Uchi is japanese-inspired
      BUT throw everything you know out the window about Japanese food. <br><br>Before
      I jump into the good good -- I wanted to note that Uchi is super accommodating
      if you have a gluten sensitivity/allergies/-free preference. So note that everything
      below is gluten-friendly or was made so! <br><br>Alright here&#39;s the good
      stuff in order of things I would order again: <br>*Walu Walu (oak-grilled escolar,
      acndied citrus, yuzupon, myoga): I&#39;ve never had escolar before, but I really
      enjoyed this mild, firm white fish. Cod-like really! The slight crust on the
      fish was tasty. Really light but flavorful dish! <br><br>*Hokkaido Uni - so
      sweet, so fresh. beautiful!! I&#39;m used to have Santa Barbara uni because
      I&#39;m from CA, but Hokkaido is SO luscious and even sweeter. <br><br>*Rabbit
      (Carrot, Black Garlic, Shiso) - specials of the day menu - You know a dish is
      good when it can recall comforting, warm memories. For me, it reminded me of
      kung pao chicken. For my tablemate, it reminded him of the curry back home.
      <br><br>*Smoked Carrot (fermented cashew, cured carrot, gremolata) - specials
      of the day menu - SUPER unique. The bite with the flax cracker (pretty caraway/fennel
      forward) reminded me of EBTB (everything but he bagel) seasoning. Super unique
      dish! <br><br>*Short Rib (tamarind jus, green apple, celery) - talk about fine
      dining plating!! The short ribs are sous vide for 72 hours and you could definitely
      tell. Love the rich flavors from the tamarind jus! I could have had an ENTIRE
      plate of this but I appreciate the restrain and bite of flavor. <br><br>*Scallop
      Crudo (aguachile, ground cherry, radish) - specials of the day menu - my tablemates
      did not enjoy this dish but I did. Granted it wasn&#39;t my favorite dish but
      the scallop pieces were generous and I liked the kick of heat. There was DEFINITELY
      some heat. <br><br>*Karaage (chicken thigh, sweet chili, seasonal pickle) -
      Definitely the most unique prep of Karaage I&#39;ve had. There were beets +
      the sweet chili was reddish so it was a little off putting with what kind of
      looked like bleeding. So it was meh for me because Karaage is not a dish that
      I need dressed up and fancy like this! <br><br>*Spicy Crunchy Tuna - again this
      was prepared gluten-free so just a bit different than regular probably. But
      it was a pretty standard roll. Go for something more interesting. <br><br>As
      for dessert -- we had the following: <br>*Fried Milk- one of Uchi&#39;s favorites
      and I get why. The fried milk was like a filled mini-doughnut hole that popped
      like XLB but you still got the deep fried goodness of a doughnut. Damn. The
      ganache was so rich.<br><br>*Foie Gras Candy Bar -- off-menu dessert! My table
      mates didn&#39;t enjoy this but I really liked the balance of sweet+savory.
      Also another awesomely unique dish.'

  - :body: After hearing about Uchi for years, I finally had the chance to come by
      during happy hour last Friday with my boyfriend, and I&#39;m delighted to say
      that it did not disappoint! From the food to the service, everything was top
      notch.<br><br>We arrived around 5:30 on a Friday afternoon without a reservation
      and were seated in a booth immediately - our server, Bronson, was very helpful
      in explaining the different parts of the menu. It was a little overwhelming,
      but we ended up ordering several things off the happy hour menu as well as some
      recommendations from Bronson and a couple of desserts. He also added on some
      complementary maki to our meal and did a great job of curating the pace and
      flow of food - I wasn&#39;t sure at first if I&#39;d feel full after the small
      bites, but I was extremely satisfied at the end of the night.<br><br>My favorites
      of the night were the masu pom (ocean trout), machi cure (smoked yellowtail),
      tempura cod, scallop nigiri (almost tofu-like consistency, not slimy at all),
      and the foie gras nigiri (savory and sweet!), but honestly, everything we had
      was delicious. The karaage was an extremely generous portion and the unique
      flavoring of the fried chicken stood out a lot. All the fish we had was extremely
      fresh, and the hot rock wagyu beef was excellent and a great experience.<br><br>The
      two desserts we ordered, the fried milk and the blueberry upside down cake,
      were also both delicious. I&#39;m not a huge fan of chocolate but the mousse
      played very well with the melty fried milk and the scoop of ice cream, and the
      taro and cake in the second dessert brought a great sweet contrast to the tartness
      of the sorbet.<br><br>Servers kept circling around with water refills and to
      take empty plates away, and the interior was brightly lit. Loved the decor.
      I&#39;m already looking forward to my next visit + trying more things off the
      menu!

      still continue to come and rave about this place. I can ALWAYS depend on Chef
      Kay and Chef Paul for a great dinner. Most of the chefs here are great, I also
      remember Chef Jamie he was great as well. <br> Also many servers here are great
      as well. Charlotte, Stephanie and another guy I want to say his name is either
      Jacob or Matthew or Mark or something. He&#39;s served us, a party of 6, and
      we ordered 25 foie gras and that&#39;s all he remembered. Haha. <br><br>Today
      however my experience was not as pleasant. I&#39;ll try not to go into too much
      detail of this situation. But the reason why it&#39;s still a 5 star review
      is because it was only one bad experience of my many great ones. <br><br>I made
      rsvp on open table to request Chef Kay, and unfortunately for me someone beat
      me to it! No worries because I&#39;ve always had a pleasant time. <br>Today
      I was with Chef Dale. Whom is also a very nice man. He did no wrong today nor
      was he at fault for anything. He served us great and delicious sushi! <br><br>Usually
      it&#39;s just my boyfriend and I coming here to eat at the sushi bar. Today
      we decided to bring a friend, since he&#39;s never been, to enjoy some fine
      sushi and a great experience. <br>For the most part that was the case...except
      when literally upon arrival, Jonathan, one of the chefs behind the sushi bar
      mumbled under his breath something that I will not mention on yelp. Not loud
      enough for everyone to hear but I heard it and saw his mouth movement. <br>I
      get it. You don&#39;t like us because we order too much foie gras. That&#39;s
      fine. But we literally try to break the ice by joking around from time to time
      but it&#39;s time to lose the attitude. <br>Don&#39;t take it out on my food.
      That&#39;s when things get ugly. He served us foie gras that was still pale
      gray. Barely any sear. And it was cold. <br>Mind you guys, we usually order
      roughly 16 orders of foie gras for us to share between the two of us. Today
      we stopped at 15 because the cold foie gras completely ruined our taste bud.
      (3rd round of 3)<br>And it&#39;s embarrassing to rave about a delicious meal
      to a friend just to be disappointed right in front of you to be asked &#34;uhhh
      is it suppose to look like that?&#34; <br>I told Chef Dale to ask if they can
      sear it a little more on the next round because this was no bueno. The next
      round came and it was probably 10% more seared than the previous. So I didn&#39;t
      want to mention it to Chef Dale again because I know it was a busy night. The
      next two rounds were better but not the best so we decided to just end the foie
      gras there. I mentioned it to Charlotte and she and Joseph took care of the
      matter. Thanks so much. <br>It was just an uneventful dinner after that. <br>I
      hope that the next guest I&#39;ll bring won&#39;t experience the same problem
      that my last did. <br>Nevertheless, as Ghandi would say, (something along these
      lines that I won&#39;t google) &#34;one drop of dirty water does not make the
      whole ocean dirty.&#34;<br><br>Also an update on what to get for my newcomers:
      <br><br>- Hirame Usuzukuri is always a must. <br>- Machi Cure and Hama chili
      has great servings during HH. (Plus the yucca chips taste better when they first
      open) <br>- If you&#39;re going to eat foie gras eat it right. That means dinner
      price and not HH way. You don&#39;t get to fully enjoy it. <br>- Akami te or
      ta (tuna and watermelon) seasonal, mainly a summer dish, absolutely delicious.
      <br>- Brussels Sprouts are always a must. <br>- Gyutoro and Hot Rock for my
      beef lovers. <br>- Unagi, Sake Toro, Ikura are a usual. <br>- Seasonal fishes
      that are a must: Rosy Sea Perch, Uni, Black Snapper, Knifejaw, Chu toro, O toro,
      Bluefin tuna, King Salmon, King Crab, and lots more. <br>- I would still get
      the fried milk as desserts. Hehe <br><br>Anyways guys, this place is still a
      5/5. <br><br>That cold foie gras left a bad taste in my mouth. So our usual
      every 2-3 weeks will probably turn into a 4-5 weeks. But as long as we&#39;re
      still coming! <br><br>----------------------------------<br><br>I love Uchi.
      No I&#39;m not the typical hype it up because it&#39;s Uchi. I will tell you
      that I wasn&#39;t a huge fan at first because it was overhyped. Especially in
      Houston. But after moving to the DFW area I&#39;m very limited to a few sushi
      spots. I like Uchi a lot because of the great food and great staff they have.
      The sushi chefs are super cool, esp. Chef Jamie.  <br>My favorites are:<br>Raw:
      <br>Hirame Usuzukuri <br>Machi Cure <br>Hama Chili <br>Madai Crudo<br><br>Cooked:

      was nice. They said it would take 30 minutes, but it seemed faster than that.<br><br>After
      looking at the menu, &#34;constant companion&#34; and I had to order the poutine.
      I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve had good poutine since we were in Toronto a few
      years ago. I still can say that because this wasn&#39;t really poutine. It was
      pretty much just fries and gravy with a few small bits of cheese under the surface.
      I don&#39;t even think they were cheese curds. They didn&#39;t seem &#34;squeaky.&#34;
      Even though it wasn&#39;t good poutine, they were good fries/gravy. <br><br>CC
      also ordered the pancake stack and added the 100% real maple syrup for $3. $3!
      For like one ounce of syrup! When the employee brought him his food, she told
      him to let her know if he needed more syrup and she&#39;d get him some for free.
      However, when we asked our server for more, she said that it would cost three
      more dollars. CC was super disappointed and ended up leaving about half of his
      pancakes uneaten because he didn&#39;t have syrup for them. And, once you have
      100% real maple, you can&#39;t go back to the cheap stuff.<br><br>Now, I know
      that they need to charge you enough to cover their costs. However, it&#39;s
      ridiculous that they charge you $3 for syrup that isn&#39;t enough for the big
      stack of pancakes that they give you. They either need to give you more syrup
      or fewer pancakes. Also, the first person shouldn&#39;t have set CC up for disappointment
      by promising him more. <br><br>I just hated seeing CC so disappointed. At first,
      he said that he&#39;d definitely come back. By the end, he was pretty defeated.
      Again, I think it was because one employee said he could get more while another
      said he&#39;d be charged. <br><br>The food is good though. It probably deserves
      4 stars, but I subtracted one for the look on CC&#39;s face when we left the

      served on a stack of Belgian waffles, topped with fresh strawberries, whipped
      cream &amp; cream puffs. Mmmm... cream puffs! <br><br>The pancake trio (2 slices
      of bacon OR 2 sausage links OR 2 sausage patties, 2 eggs any style &amp; Pancakes)
      wasn&#39;t s bad look. Both their pancakes &amp; waffles are huge! <br><br>One
      of my friends ordered the soup of the day (beef vegetable) &amp; the Salt &amp;
      Vinegar Fish &amp; Chips (salt and vinegar potato chip crusted Alaskan cod served
      with fresh cut fries). He mentioned that everything was a bit salty... especially
      the fish.<br><br>My other friend ordered the French Toast and Strawberries (brioche
      bread dipped in eggs, light cream, cinnamon, sugar and vanilla, pan fried and
      served with fresh strawberries, cream puffs). No complaints were given.<br><br>All
      and all, I&#39;d recommend a visit. One star was loss due to constant reminder
      of items we had asked for and took time (as in a few reminders when they&#39;d
      come and check in on us) to finally get.'

      it is much cheaper than the rest of the menu. It came with 4 fried pickles as
      a side - wish it came with fries or onion rings to make the meal feel a bit
      fuller <br><br>The food was super hot and I burned myself :( wish I would&#39;ve

      50 minutes. People were waiting both inside and outside of the restaurant!<br><br>Service

      the turkey sausage...the turkey sausage was a hit! I found there drinks to be
      a bit pricy. A glass of mimosa is $6 so we decided to purchase 2 bottles of
      champagne and order the juice on the side (it was 3 of us). The bottles are
      $26 (we usually pay $20-$22) at other locations and the cups of juice were $2
      each (no free refills). I&#39;d definitely recommend them for the food but if

      they were not my favorite - the frosting on the top was too pasty. The waffles
      were good though.<br><br>My SO and one of our friends both got milkshakes. I
      guess their ice cream was extremely hard because we watched the person making

      For like one ounce of syrup! When the employee brought him his food, she told
      him to let her know if he needed more syrup and she&#39;d get him some for free.
      However, when we asked our server for more, she said that it would cost three
      more dollars. CC was super disappointed and ended up leaving about half of his
      pancakes uneaten because he didn&#39;t have syrup for them. And, once you have
      100% real maple, you can&#39;t go back to the cheap stuff.<br><br>Now, I know

      ridiculous that they charge you $3 for syrup that isn&#39;t enough for the big

    :body: Food was good, I got the veggie burger. Portion was on the small side but
      it is much cheaper than the rest of the menu. It came with 4 fried pickles as
      a side - wish it came with fries or onion rings to make the meal feel a bit
      fuller <br><br>The food was super hot and I burned myself :( wish I would&#39;ve

      I got there for a Saturday brunch, we were told that the wait is going to be
      50 minutes. People were waiting both inside and outside of the restaurant!<br><br>Service
      is fast and friendly. We were able to order as soon as we got seated. I ordered
      the french toast with fresh strawberries, and it was really yummy! I love how
      the french toast was fluffy and chewy.<br><br>My friend got the chicken and
      waffles. She really loved it, but the portion size was way too big for her.
      If you decide to get the chicken and waffles, I recommend sharing it with one
      other person.<br><br>All in all, this is the place to be if you are looking
      for an affordable yet delicious brunch food!

    :comment: Chicken, Bacon, Waffle.
    :body: Food was great! My friends has the Chicken, bacon and waffles and latkes
      (hash browns). I wasn&#39;t hungry so I had the &#39;Light&#39; breakfast with
      the turkey sausage...the turkey sausage was a hit! I found there drinks to be
      a bit pricy. A glass of mimosa is $6 so we decided to purchase 2 bottles of
      champagne and order the juice on the side (it was 3 of us). The bottles are
      $26 (we usually pay $20-$22) at other locations and the cups of juice were $2
      each (no free refills). I&#39;d definitely recommend them for the food but if
      you&#39;re wanting to brunch with drinks, there are better options in the area.
      I did appreciate the free cookie with my Yelp check it! I can&#39;t explain
      how delicious the white chocolate raspberry cookie was. I may be back just for
      a dozen of those!

    :body: Stopped in for breakfast with some friends during a recent visit to Dallas.
      We got some of the most ridiculous dishes. I opted for the Chicken, Bacon, and
      Waffles which came complete with two tiny cream puffs on top! Unfortunately,
      they were not my favorite - the frosting on the top was too pasty. The waffles
      were good though.<br><br>My SO and one of our friends both got milkshakes. I
      guess their ice cream was extremely hard because we watched the person making
      them painstakingly struggle to scoop enough into the cup to make each one. It
      took probably 15 min for each one to come out! For a place billed as a &#34;milk
      bar&#34; this was a surprise.

      Fort Worth and this is my second visit to this location. <br><br>Decided to
      give it one more try before writing a review since I&#39;ve only heard good
      things about this place. Sadly, I am not a fan. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the
      burgers are ok. But that&#39;s just it, they are just OK.<br><br>I do appreciate
      the ring toss game at the front door of this location. It gives people something
      to do while waiting to be seated. <br><br>My coworkers and I visited during
      lunch. It was pretty busy but we were seated within 10 minutes. We were a party
      of 10 and they provided us with the world&#39;s smallest seating area. Thank
      the Lord we actually like each other since we were seated practically on top
      of each other&#39;s laps...lol.<br><br>I ordered the Chaca Oaxaca. It consists
      of a beef patty with chorizo inside, avocado, pico de gallo, fried egg, queso
      fresco, and tabasco mayo. Due to dietary restrictions, I opted to swap out the
      bun for lettuce and tomato. The food was served in a timely fashion. The beef
      was cooked the way I liked and seasoned well. For some reason, I was not a fan
      of the flavoring of the chorizo combined with the beef. For me, it could have
      been seasoned and cooked differently to provide a better combined flavor profile.<br><br>I
      tried some of the fries. They were subpar; nothing too special to write home
      about. Some of the fries were overly salty while others were not salted at all.<br><br>At
      best, this experience was ok. I recall all 3 of my experiences at this franchise

  - :body: Not sure if you have heard of this place, I hadn&#39;t but my family wouldn&#39;t
      stop talking about it.  So I found my self over by Love Field and decided to
      try it with my daughter.  She told me it was a great spot and usually crowded.
       <br><br>It was 6 pm on a Wednesday and parking lot only had a few spaces left.
       The spaces are VERY, VERY Narrow and I drive a big pick up so I ended up in
      two paces. Sorry about that, it happens sometimes despite my efforts!<br><br>Upon
      entering the place, which looks like an old industrial building from the outside,
      we walked into a wide open spaces restaurant full of people.  They have what
      looks like community seating or very large group tables upon first entering
      and then the more common booths/tables in the back, which is where we found
      a seat. <br><br>The Goat has a great menu of burgers to chose from as you can
      see from my picture.  They also have the burger wars, where they pit two popular
      burger against each other for the month and see who wins.  Complete with tote
      board above the kitchen so you can see the running totals.  <br><br>I chose
      the &#34;In da Club&#34; burger, which is really a bacon cheeseburger with added
      smoked ham on a pretzel bun.   The bun is very big, so the burger looks bigger
      than it actually is and it comes with no sauce (Mayo, Ketchup, Mustard).  The
      meat is nice and juicy and comes out hot. Served with the typical LTP condiments
      as well.  I had the fries and man they were so hard to stop eating. perfectly
      crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and Thick!<br><br>My daughter
      had the Cheese fries with surprise, which is Chili. Sorry for ruining the surprise,
      but it&#39;s chili sauce they put on top. Because it was happy hour time it
      came out as the full order not the half order and it was the same price.  the
      full order is HUGE. <br><br>To finish the meal we got the Goat Balls.  yup,
      we ate some cheese filled goat balls and I loved them.  It could be because
      they were fresh made with powder sugar and blackberry compote on top.  Think
      beignets with cheese inside.   <br><br>Overall I thought the food was great,
      the atmosphere was fantastic. it is worth the trip or two.

  - :body: One big thing I&#39;ve noticed about Rodeo Goat is the amazing service
      - our waiter was very attentive and receptive to conversation with us. I got
      the cheese fries surprise (the surprise is chili + jalapenos + cheese on fries)
      and a Royale with Cheese. <br><br>Burgers come with a side of pickles and are
      cooked to order. No doubt about it, these burgers have high quality meat and
      great toppings - the only thing that I have to point out is that the buns are
      bit soggy and tend to fall apart if not handled too delicately.<br><br>Also,
      don&#39;t try to split the cheese fries between two people - I think it&#39;s
      more of a 4-5 person job. Fries here are a thicker cut, so if you like thinner
      fries (like What-a-burger fries or Wing Stop fries), this may not be to your
      liking!

      of mine @PhilC left a review. Since I know he appreciates a great place, I had
      to try it. It was so good I went twice in one week!<br><br>I tried the Ranch
      House burger, goat chips, cheese fries (with no surprise) and a cider.<br>All
      were delicious and the servers worked hard to get our order to our table. They
      seem to work like a team and whoever could help brought our food and drinks
      as we saw several servers throughout the night.<br><br>My first night I sat
      alone at the bar and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere there while ordering off
      the menu from my bar stool. I loved that you could enjoy a meal alone at the
      bar or have a nice conversation with a fellow business traveler. The bar tender
      was super helpful and made some great suggestions.<br><br>I did not order dessert

  - :body: Hubby and I showed up for an earlier dinner at 6p.  The restaurant was
      busy, but most looked like they were there for drinks.  Our first time here
      and the menu is obnoxiously long.  The waitress did not give us much time to
      to through the menu and kept coming to our table to take our order.<br><br>It
      took almost 20 minutes to get two burgers and two chips.  Hubby and I shared
      the White Animal and HL Hunt.  The meat was a overcooked and dry.  The mushrooms
      were stingy on the White Animal, we could barely detect the blackberry compote
      on the HL Hunt, and both sweet and sour chips were a bowl of burnt chip dust.
       Hubby&#39;s water was empty, and the waitress, who was so eager to take our
      order earlier, never returned to our table.<br><br>A guy who looked like a manager
      because he was doing everything finally came to our table to clear the dishes
      and ask us how we were doing.  I showed him the bowls of potato dust, he asked
      if I wanted a fresh order to go, and when I said no, he pleasantly surprised
      us and comp&#39;d the chips.  This one display of service earned the extra star
      for this review.<br><br>There are a lot of other better burger places in town.
       Sorry Rodeo Goat, you totally underwhelmed us.

  - :body: I&#39;m generally not a fan of burgers, but I&#39;ll make an exception
      for Rodeo Goat! <br><br>I&#39;ve been here twice now. The first time, I got
      the Impossible Burger, which surprisingly tasted like meat. Maybe it&#39;s because
      I knew it wasn&#39;t made with meat products, but I didn&#39;t really like the
      taste of it. <br><br>This time, I got the Neil Young - I was drawn to it because
      it has avocado in it, and I LOVE my avocado! I loved this veggie burger! My
      only complaint would be that the avocado was sliced in 2 large pieces, and they
      fell out of the burger very easily, but that&#39;s hardly a complaint! Honestly,
      burgers get messy no matter how you put it together. <br><br>I love the down-to-earth
      vibe of this place - it&#39;s a cool place to chill out after work. I came here
      with 10+ friends, and they still had relatively quick service, checking in with
      us every 10 mins or so. <br><br>PS - The outdoor seating has a roof over it
      and has fans, so even when it&#39;s sunny out, it&#39;s still pretty nice to
      sit outside! Dogs are allowed! :) I saw a couple cute corgis and some other
      doggos during my last visit here!<br><br>Parking can get a little crowded in
      the evening ~6-7pm, but there is a decent-sized parking lot in front of the
      restaurant. The spaces are a little narrow, however, so it may be hard to park
      if you have a large car.

  - :body: Food+ environment= 4 Stars (although the environment definitely is amazing,
      I only have one reservation on the burgers themselves- read on to see what I
      mean). I got one of the burgers from the top of the menu that are &#34;battling
      it out&#34;. You cast your vote by ordering which of the two you want. The Wicked
      Felina is what I chose, although it is not a permanent menu option- if you see
      it, TRY IT! It&#39;s got CORN and QUESO on it! YUM. The ONLY problem I have
      with their burgers, as you can read from other reviews, is the bottom bun completely
      melts into goo from all the grease that comes off the patty. I ended up having
      to take off the bottom bun (what was left of it- looked more like wet sop after
      about 5 minutes). I love a greasy burger, but maybe layering the toppings differently
      could help with the bun issue. I don&#39;t know the solution, really, but the
      food was still fantastic regardless. <br><br>Don&#39;t skip on the cheese fries
      supreme. They can feed a family of four- my husband and I shared them and could
      barely get half eaten. SO GOOD and well worth the money. <br><br>We had a fun
      time. We sat outside near the cornhole game and firepit and let our daughter
      play with the beanbags while we enjoyed our super cheap buckets of beer and
      watched the memorial day fireworks from the Hilton Anatole across the street.
      We also enjoyed the view of the ferris wheel next door and their lively music.
      We will definitely be back.

  - :body: Not my first time here. But probably my last. Came in on a Sunday night
      this time. About an hour and 20 min before close. We sat down at a table and
      it looked like it hadn&#39;t been wiped down. So we did it I ourselves because
      the waitress seemed to be really busy. When she got to us she let us know the
      kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. Ok no problem. We ordered a few drinks and
      our food. My bf got the The Ranch House or something like that and I got the
      Sam Sham. Took us probably 15 minutes to get our drinks even though it wasn&#39;t
      really that busy. And at least 30 to get our food which I thought was strange
      because again it isn&#39;t busy and the kitchen would be trying to close up
      at that point. <br><br>The fries came out lukewarm but seasoned well. My bf
      loved his burger. It looked really good. My burger on the other hand was a mess.
      The bacon was undercooked and over cooked at the same time. That&#39;s talent.
      The ends were burnt crispy black. And the middle was undercooked and chewy so
      I had to take that off the burger. The onion ring I got on the side instead
      of on the burger was bland and cold and not crispy but chewy. The bottom bun
      was so soggy it fell apart in my hand when eating it. The burger though was
      tasty after removing the bacon. <br><br>When the server came to check in us
      it was literally a drive by. She didn&#39;t stop when she asked &#34;everything
      good?&#34; So that&#39;s cool... and when trying to get the check it took foreverrrrr!!
      Over all it was like $60 for 2 burgers fries and 3 drinks. A little pricey for
      a mediocre meal. <br><br>So strike for bad service, strike for cleanliness and
      strike for burger mishaps. Not sure I will return since this trip was so lack
      luster.

    :comment: Ranch burger, no bun, with salad.
    :body: I tried Rodeo Goat on my last trip to Dallas because a Chicago Yelp Friend
      of mine @PhilC left a review. Since I know he appreciates a great place, I had
      to try it. It was so good I went twice in one week!<br><br>I tried the Ranch
      House burger, goat chips, cheese fries (with no surprise) and a cider.<br>All
      were delicious and the servers worked hard to get our order to our table. They
      seem to work like a team and whoever could help brought our food and drinks
      as we saw several servers throughout the night.<br><br>My first night I sat
      alone at the bar and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere there while ordering off
      the menu from my bar stool. I loved that you could enjoy a meal alone at the
      bar or have a nice conversation with a fellow business traveler. The bar tender
      was super helpful and made some great suggestions.<br><br>I did not order dessert
      but it looked tempting, especially the fried pecan pie! I can&#39;t wait to
      return next trip to Dallas.

    :comment: Bowl of burnt chip dust
    :body: Hubby and I showed up for an earlier dinner at 6p.  The restaurant was
      busy, but most looked like they were there for drinks.  Our first time here
      and the menu is obnoxiously long.  The waitress did not give us much time to
      to through the menu and kept coming to our table to take our order.<br><br>It
      took almost 20 minutes to get two burgers and two chips.  Hubby and I shared
      the White Animal and HL Hunt.  The meat was a overcooked and dry.  The mushrooms
      were stingy on the White Animal, we could barely detect the blackberry compote
      on the HL Hunt, and both sweet and sour chips were a bowl of burnt chip dust.
       Hubby&#39;s water was empty, and the waitress, who was so eager to take our
      order earlier, never returned to our table.<br><br>A guy who looked like a manager
      because he was doing everything finally came to our table to clear the dishes
      and ask us how we were doing.  I showed him the bowls of potato dust, he asked
      if I wanted a fresh order to go, and when I said no, he pleasantly surprised
      us and comp&#39;d the chips.  This one display of service earned the extra star
      for this review.<br><br>There are a lot of other better burger places in town.
       Sorry Rodeo Goat, you totally underwhelmed us.

    :comment: Neil Young &amp; Cheese fries no surprise
    :body: I&#39;m generally not a fan of burgers, but I&#39;ll make an exception
      for Rodeo Goat! <br><br>I&#39;ve been here twice now. The first time, I got
      the Impossible Burger, which surprisingly tasted like meat. Maybe it&#39;s because
      I knew it wasn&#39;t made with meat products, but I didn&#39;t really like the
      taste of it. <br><br>This time, I got the Neil Young - I was drawn to it because
      it has avocado in it, and I LOVE my avocado! I loved this veggie burger! My
      only complaint would be that the avocado was sliced in 2 large pieces, and they
      fell out of the burger very easily, but that&#39;s hardly a complaint! Honestly,
      burgers get messy no matter how you put it together. <br><br>I love the down-to-earth
      vibe of this place - it&#39;s a cool place to chill out after work. I came here
      with 10+ friends, and they still had relatively quick service, checking in with
      us every 10 mins or so. <br><br>PS - The outdoor seating has a roof over it
      and has fans, so even when it&#39;s sunny out, it&#39;s still pretty nice to
      sit outside! Dogs are allowed! :) I saw a couple cute corgis and some other
      doggos during my last visit here!<br><br>Parking can get a little crowded in
      the evening ~6-7pm, but there is a decent-sized parking lot in front of the
      restaurant. The spaces are a little narrow, however, so it may be hard to park
      if you have a large car.

      the waitress seemed to be really busy. When she got to us she let us know the
      kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. Ok no problem. We ordered a few drinks and
      our food. My bf got the The Ranch House or something like that and I got the
      Sam Sham. Took us probably 15 minutes to get our drinks even though it wasn&#39;t
      really that busy. And at least 30 to get our food which I thought was strange
      because again it isn&#39;t busy and the kitchen would be trying to close up
      at that point. <br><br>The fries came out lukewarm but seasoned well. My bf
      loved his burger. It looked really good. My burger on the other hand was a mess.
      The bacon was undercooked and over cooked at the same time. That&#39;s talent.
      The ends were burnt crispy black. And the middle was undercooked and chewy so
      I had to take that off the burger. The onion ring I got on the side instead
      of on the burger was bland and cold and not crispy but chewy. The bottom bun
      was so soggy it fell apart in my hand when eating it. The burger though was
      tasty after removing the bacon. <br><br>When the server came to check in us
      it was literally a drive by. She didn&#39;t stop when she asked &#34;everything
      good?&#34; So that&#39;s cool... and when trying to get the check it took foreverrrrr!!
      Over all it was like $60 for 2 burgers fries and 3 drinks. A little pricey for
      a mediocre meal. <br><br>So strike for bad service, strike for cleanliness and
      strike for burger mishaps. Not sure I will return since this trip was so lack

      you to Ms. Bindel for taking care of our meal when we came- we greatly appreciate
      it and I&#39;m so glad I came back here to give it a second chance. Another
      shout-out to Josafat for being an amazing server when we came. He was very pleasant
      and was able to answer all of our questions about the menu. Thank you Josafat!
      <br><br>Overall experience: It was ten times better than last time. Luckily,
      I checked on yelp and noticed there was an hour wait to get into this place.
      I checked us in (my husband, myself, and my brother) through yelp and we were
      seated within 20 minutes. The ladies at the front were so sweet and had great
      table manners. <br><br>Food: We all ordered a couple of their soufflés to try
      out. We ordered the lobster soufflé (not shown on the menu) and it was better
      than I expected. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the outer layer but the actual lobster
      meat was tender. We finished this soufflé rather quickly. Then, we ordered a
      chocolate, raspberry, and banana pudding soufflés and were pleasantly surprised
      at the flavor profile. I ordered the chocolate soufflé the last time I came
      and it was a disappointment. This time around, it was so delicious! Not an ounce
      of egg whites were tasted- we pretty much finished this. The banana pudding
      soufflé was also very good and my husband&#39;s favorite. Our least favorite
      was the raspberry soufflé which tasted mostly like egg whites (sadly- we expected
      it to taste better). The sauces that accompany each soufflé enhanced the flavor(s)
      which made the soufflés taste better (minus the raspberry). The gateau de chocolat
      was okay- we&#39;ve had better &#39;lava cake&#39; before but still worth trying.

      truly enjoyed our time here and left feeling satisfied.'

      take reservations, they would do cute table scrabble tiles welcoming the party.

  - :body: What a fun experience!<br><br>I had a blast taking my wife here on a post
      Hamilton-date (yay!) and it was so nice to eat somewhere that felt like an experience.<br><br>I
      must be honest and tell you that while the souffles were delicious, my favorite
      part of the meal was their pre-dinner bread that has a little guillotine you
      can chop it with. Way too entertaining and way too much fun!<br><br>We each
      got a savory souffle and each got a dessert souffle. If I could go back in time,
      I&#39;d order something beside the crab as it needs more flavor above what it&#39;s
      already got going on. BUT if you can split or share across with someone who&#39;s
      getting a different flavor, all your bites will be much more balanced.<br><br>As
      far as dessert went, the chocolate souffle was lights out. LIGHTS. OUT. It&#39;s
      a shame because it made me like my pistachio one less in all the best ways;
      the pistachio flavor just didn&#39;t cut through as much as I wanted. <br><br>It&#39;s
      ok though, as there are so many flavors to try I can&#39;t wait to come back
      and try them all!<br><br>Props too to our server who was truly delightful and
      a complete role model for how service should be. This is a great little spot
      and I&#39;m so glad we have it in Dallas!

  - :body: BEST SOUFFLES EVER. We got 3 soufflés and a wine flight, and each soufflés
      was just as delicious and bouncy as the next. We got the truffle mushroom, crab,
      and raspberry soufflés. My favorite was the dessert soufflé - it was so poofy,
      so sweet, so beautiful in every way!<br><br>I really liked the wall lined with
      bottles on bottles of wine, as well as the creative ways they used tree branches
      as decoration throughout the restaurant. I also liked the napkins - they looked
      like cute drawings on their cloth napkins. I appreciate these small touches
      of attention in making the restaurant feel homey and cozy.<br><br>I also appreciated
      the open kitchen, as we watched each soufflé as it was taken out of the oven,
      all poofy and warm and ready to be served.<br><br>PS - I recommend calling to
      get a reservation, as this place gets very busy! Parking is plentiful in this
      area!

      (hence the name).  <br><br>I ordered the crab souffle and my friend ordered
      the ham and gruyere.  The crab was the lightest, fluffiest cloud of a crab cake.
       TONS of crab meat, would definitely order again.   I can&#39;t personally speak
      to the ham and gruyere, but my friend left nothing behind - so that speaks for
      itself!  <br><br>Dessert souffles ordered were Grand Marnier (mine) and apricot
      (hers).  We both loved ours but by that time we were stuffed to the brim and

    :comment: Outside patio
    :body: 'I came here on a weekend for brunch during the holidays. We didn&#39;t
      have to wait and were seated immediately on the outside patio. <br><br>Atmosphere:
      <br>Ample seating both inside and outside. The inside is dimly lit with festive
      lights and tons of cozy directions reminiscent of the French countryside. This
      is kind of random but the bathroom is very nicely decorated and has a shared
      bathroom style. The outside patio has a long layout and is more quiet and relaxed
      than inside with natural lighting. <br><br>Food:<br>I shared 3 soufflés, which
      was more than filling because they are quite large! We had the Duck a&#39;lOrange
      savory soufflé, the crab savory soufflé, and the pumpkin soufflé. Many of these
      were seasonal and they were a treat! My favorite was the Duck, it was so rich
      and delicious and unlike anything I&#39;ve tried. I also loved their bread contraption
      (see photo)<br><br>----------<br>Update:<br>I recently came with my puppy and
      received fabulous welcoming service on their enclosed patio. The manager or
      someone with the restaurant even gave my husband and I a free desert voucher
      (I believe it was because of our service with the military but also because
      our little puppy was doing so well)! We had the best time and can&#39;t wait
      to return. This time we tried the &#34;marshmallow&#34; soup that was actually
      goat cheese with a delicious tomato carrot soup, in addition to the mushroom
      truffle soufflé (strong flavor!) and the sausage soufflé (great for breakfast).'

    :body: BEST SOUFFLES EVER. We got 3 soufflés and a wine flight, and each soufflés
      was just as delicious and bouncy as the next. We got the truffle mushroom, crab,
      and raspberry soufflés. My favorite was the dessert soufflé - it was so poofy,
      so sweet, so beautiful in every way!<br><br>I really liked the wall lined with
      bottles on bottles of wine, as well as the creative ways they used tree branches
      as decoration throughout the restaurant. I also liked the napkins - they looked
      like cute drawings on their cloth napkins. I appreciate these small touches
      of attention in making the restaurant feel homey and cozy.<br><br>I also appreciated
      the open kitchen, as we watched each soufflé as it was taken out of the oven,
      all poofy and warm and ready to be served.<br><br>PS - I recommend calling to
      get a reservation, as this place gets very busy! Parking is plentiful in this
      area!

  - :body: Best Italian market in the region! They have meats and pasta you will not

      come and shop here. <br><br>Easy to find and generally lots of parking, except

      and it will likely be here OR the ingredients to make it plus the wine to wash
      it down!<br><br>On this trip, mission was to look at the fresh produce options
      available, specifically peaches.  It was a busy Saturday afternoon. The sandwich
      shop tables were mostly full. The check out line was  nearly long and the deli
      meat counter had a line.  So I decided to just look about.  I got a kick out
      of listening to the people discuss frozen pasta as they said it was the best
      ever!  Another couple were discussing the various canned and bottled sauces
      and how this one was better than that one. A couple of guys were commenting
      on the muffaletta being the best in the South! The produce looked quite good.
      This place ALWAYS has the best tomatoes! The Texas Peaches looked good. <br><br>I
      decided I&#39;d wait until later this week to come back, shop and grab a sandwich
      when the crowd was smaller.

  - :body: I thought the sandwiches we tried here were too salty. We had the mulfeletta
      (needed something to balance out the intense saltiness of the olives and salami)
      and the Italian stallion (had a good variety of meats but still also too salty).
      However, I did feel like the meats were very fresh, particularly the prosciutto
      in the Italian stallion, which was amazing. The sandwiches were also huge, so
      very much worth the value.<br><br>Also tried their Italian cream cake, which
      we took home and heated up. So delicious when warm - loved the pecans.

      Fresh meats and cheeses along with the house made lasagna and ravioli selection

      and European foods. Even for speciality items that are now carried by main line
      grocers, Jimmy&#39;s most likely has several more brands of that same item.
      And they most likely have brands you have not heard of and that are probably
      a bit better quality than what you might find elsewhere. But that&#39;s not
      all.<br><br>They have a large selection of speciality wines. They have pre-made

      grandparents owned one when I was little), most of which are in older buildings

      check them out. They also have wine tastings and I believe they may hold cooking

      running at White Rock Lake and got their large muffuletta. It was ENORMOUS (9
      inch for $14.99). That comprised of multiple meals I brought to work. Only critique
      was that it was too salty for my taste. <br><br>Really enjoyed walking up and
      down the aisles to see the Italian speciality products. Parking can be somewhat

  - :body: Jimmy&#39;s Food Store is a must go to in Dallas! Not only for great sandwiches,
      but to buy local produce, deli meats, and groceries. Being from Rhode Island
      with a very high Italian population and stores like this in almost every city,
      Jimmy&#39;s took me back being in Providence. I recommend coming to Jimmy&#39;s
      as early as possible, the parking situation gets hectic. As you walk in, you
      are hit with the smells of Italy- deli meat, fresh olives, and of course cheese.
      You can get a glass of wine at the register for $4 while you shop/wait for your
      food. The deli is in the back-probably on purpose so you can gaze over the delicious
      food. The sandwiches order (pictured in the review) were the 6&#34; Italian
      sub, large muffuletta, and the chicken Italian. All fresh ingredients, made
      to order, and of course- delicious. The large muffuletta literally could feed
      an entire family. The customer service was excellent. I did not have any questions
      about the menu but people after me had some questions about what was good/what
      ingredients were in the food, and they were quick to answer all questions. I
      highly recommend Jimmy&#39;s to anyone in the DFW area, I will be back!

      to the back deli counter to order some sandwiches. I got the Muffalata, if you
      like green olives then this is a great option. He asked 6 or 9 inches.....i
      was thinking sub sandwich so I said 9. No one needs a nine unless you are sharing,
      it was the size of my head. My gf got the Italian stallion and that was a sub
      loaded with yumminess. <br><br>While we waited we walked around looking at the
      market, any Italian product you can think of was there, will have to go back
      when I&#39;m not starving. <br><br>We picked out our drinks....LOTS OF OPTIONS
      and sat at a table in the front of the store, outside seating also available.
      <br><br>Before we left I got two pints of Henry&#39;s homemade ice cream....Spumoni
      flavor!!! It&#39;s delicious by the way &amp; made local. <br><br>The only negative
      is the usual crappy parking situation of uptown/downtown. We got lucky but foresee

  - :body: This little food store is such a gem in Dallas. There&#39;s FRESH produce
      and tons of imported goods from Italy/Europe. When you walk in it&#39;s a little
      Italian grocery store, and when you go to the back they have a deli where you
      can buy meats but also order freshly made sandwiches. In the back of that there&#39;s
      a little seating area with an ample amount of tables and chairs.<br><br>It seems
      they have everything you could ever need to make the perfect Italian meal! They
      also have frozen/ready made lasagnas, pizzas, and other goodies. <br><br>The
      sandwiches my friend and I got were both delicious! She got the Italian stallion
      which had probably every Italian deli meat you could think of, cheese, lettuce,
      tomatoes, and peppers. Maybe some other additions as well! I got the chicken
      Italiano which is a hot sandwich and was recommended to me by my deli dude!<br><br>Both
      were excellent and the Italian stallion was so huge for $8.99! You could definitely
      split the full size with someone. I ate all of my chicken italiano which was
      $6.99! It was soooo good, and I prefer hot sandwiches so I loved mine way more.
      The cheese pull was unreal on this bad boy. Check out the pic.<br><br>Overall
      this place is a pretty affordable sandwich stop with tons of Italian grocery
      goodies to marvel at!! They also have $4 glasses of wine as pictured. The parking
      can be a little hairy, but we came on a Friday afternoon and were able to find
      a spot along the street! There weren&#39;t many spots however.

      Italian grocer/deli/sandwich shop/cafe where they sell all sorts of products

    :body: Dallas is lucky to have a store like this. And many in Dallas still don&#39;t
      know about it somehow. Go and discover it, if you haven&#39;t already.<br><br>Right
      up front, you should know that parking will be tough. Just expect that. It&#39;s
      the way it is in this part of town.<br><br>And Jimmy&#39;s Food Store is so
      much more than a food store. It&#39;s a food store for hard to find Italian
      and European foods. Even for speciality items that are now carried by main line
      grocers, Jimmy&#39;s most likely has several more brands of that same item.
      And they most likely have brands you have not heard of and that are probably
      a bit better quality than what you might find elsewhere. But that&#39;s not
      all.<br><br>They have a large selection of speciality wines. They have pre-made
      meals and menu items, many made in house. Others are made by small specialty
      food producers. Need a real Italian lasagne? Get Jimmy&#39;s own right here.<br><br>The
      meat is second to none. Top quality fresh meat. The salumi and charcuterie counters
      have things you just won&#39;t find at most places in town. And they have great
      quality for all of it.<br><br>Need baked goods? Look for the &#34;My sister&#39;s&#34;
      line--all made in house. The prepackaged stuff is mostly good too.<br><br>Want
      to eat now? The sandwiches here are to die for--as good as anything you can
      get on the east coast. If you haven&#39;t had one, you owe it to yourself to
      fix that oversight. Don&#39;t miss the wine room in the back. Big personality
      in this space. Go there to eat.<br><br>Service is friendly and helpful. Can&#39;t
      find something? Ask. Want them to try and get something they don&#39;t have
      currently? Just ask (and they can probably do it).<br><br>I almost gave Jimmy&#39;s

    :body: THIS !!!!!! Is the Italian Beef sandwich at Jimmys Food Store in Dallas.
      <br>Sliced Beef, Gravy, Provolone, Pepper Giardiniera<br>Sooooooooo Delicious
      I almost sat there and ate 2. If you are in the area and love fresh Italian
      produce, meat, wines, seasoning, cheese, and hand crafted sandwiches you should
      check them out. They also have wine tastings and I believe they may hold cooking
      classes as well. I do know that you can drink wine while you shop. Check em
      out.

    :comment: Chicken Italian
    :body: Jimmy&#39;s Food Store is a must go to in Dallas! Not only for great sandwiches,
      but to buy local produce, deli meats, and groceries. Being from Rhode Island
      with a very high Italian population and stores like this in almost every city,
      Jimmy&#39;s took me back being in Providence. I recommend coming to Jimmy&#39;s
      as early as possible, the parking situation gets hectic. As you walk in, you
      are hit with the smells of Italy- deli meat, fresh olives, and of course cheese.
      You can get a glass of wine at the register for $4 while you shop/wait for your
      food. The deli is in the back-probably on purpose so you can gaze over the delicious
      food. The sandwiches order (pictured in the review) were the 6&#34; Italian
      sub, large muffuletta, and the chicken Italian. All fresh ingredients, made
      to order, and of course- delicious. The large muffuletta literally could feed
      an entire family. The customer service was excellent. I did not have any questions
      about the menu but people after me had some questions about what was good/what
      ingredients were in the food, and they were quick to answer all questions. I
      highly recommend Jimmy&#39;s to anyone in the DFW area, I will be back!

      was thinking sub sandwich so I said 9. No one needs a nine unless you are sharing,
      it was the size of my head. My gf got the Italian stallion and that was a sub
      loaded with yumminess. <br><br>While we waited we walked around looking at the
      market, any Italian product you can think of was there, will have to go back
      when I&#39;m not starving. <br><br>We picked out our drinks....LOTS OF OPTIONS
      and sat at a table in the front of the store, outside seating also available.
      <br><br>Before we left I got two pints of Henry&#39;s homemade ice cream....Spumoni
      flavor!!! It&#39;s delicious by the way &amp; made local. <br><br>The only negative

    :comment: Chicken Italiano
    :body: This little food store is such a gem in Dallas. There&#39;s FRESH produce
      and tons of imported goods from Italy/Europe. When you walk in it&#39;s a little
      Italian grocery store, and when you go to the back they have a deli where you
      can buy meats but also order freshly made sandwiches. In the back of that there&#39;s
      a little seating area with an ample amount of tables and chairs.<br><br>It seems
      they have everything you could ever need to make the perfect Italian meal! They
      also have frozen/ready made lasagnas, pizzas, and other goodies. <br><br>The
      sandwiches my friend and I got were both delicious! She got the Italian stallion
      which had probably every Italian deli meat you could think of, cheese, lettuce,
      tomatoes, and peppers. Maybe some other additions as well! I got the chicken
      Italiano which is a hot sandwich and was recommended to me by my deli dude!<br><br>Both
      were excellent and the Italian stallion was so huge for $8.99! You could definitely
      split the full size with someone. I ate all of my chicken italiano which was
      $6.99! It was soooo good, and I prefer hot sandwiches so I loved mine way more.
      The cheese pull was unreal on this bad boy. Check out the pic.<br><br>Overall
      this place is a pretty affordable sandwich stop with tons of Italian grocery
      goodies to marvel at!! They also have $4 glasses of wine as pictured. The parking
      can be a little hairy, but we came on a Friday afternoon and were able to find
      a spot along the street! There weren&#39;t many spots however.
